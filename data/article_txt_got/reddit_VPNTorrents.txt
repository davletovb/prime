[GUIDE] Bind VPN network interface to torrent client to avoid exposing your IP,"This guide assumes you already have a VPN. If you don't then: 

[List of recommended VPNs for torrenting (2022)](

---

VPN killswitches aren't reliable, the best way to avoid exposing your IP address is by binding the VPN network interface to the torrent client. This means that you'll only be able to download/upload while the VPN tunnel is active, reducing the probability of having a leak to virtually zero.

**Requirements:** A torrent client [that supports binding]( eg. qBittorrent (Windows, macOS and Linux) or BiglyBT (Android). The instructions below are for qBittorrent.

**Method 1**

- Open qBittorrent. Go to Preferences, and then Advanced tab.
- Check for the differences on the ""Network Interface"" list when you connect/disconnect VPN (you may have to restart qBittorrent for the list to refresh).
- Select (bind) the one that shows up/disappears from the previous test.
- Restart qBittorrent.

**Method 2**

*Windows*

- Start the VPN and connect to a location.
- Open qBittorrent. Go to Preferences, and then Advanced tab.
- Change Network interface to the VPN (usually its name, like ""Mullvad"").
- Restart qBittorrent.

*macOS*

- Start the VPN and connect to a location.
- Open the Terminal app (it's in Applications/Utilities).
- Run the command ""ifconfig | grep -A 2 utun"" (without """")
- Take note of the utun interface with the internal IP ""inet 10.x.x.x"" (eg. ""utun3"").
- Open qBittorrent. Go to Preferences, and then Advanced tab.
- Change Network interface to the utun interface you found above.
- Restart qBittorrent.

Note: The utun interface may change if you reboot or reconnect.

*Linux*

- Start the VPN and connect to a location.
- Open qBittorrent. Go to Preferences, and then Advanced tab.
- Change Network interface to one of the following depending on the app and protocol you are using (Mullvad VPN as example)
    - Mullvad app using OpenVPN: tun0
    - Mullvad app using WireGuard kernel: wg-mullvad
    - Mullvad app using WireGuard userspace: tun0
    - WireGuard standalone: mlvd-xx
    - OpenVPN standalone: tun0
- Restart qBittorrent.

**How to test?**

You can [download the official Ubuntu 21.10 torrent]( and open it on qBittorrent. If the binding is properly set, the download will only start if the VPN is connected. If you disconnect, the download will stop.

How long do I need to keep my VPN on?," Maybe this is a stupid question, but I really don't know anything so I'll ask anyway. I've recently started dappling in downloading torrents (I use transmission,) I know that it's important to use a VPN but it really slows down my computer and whatever I'm trying to do on my browser. Do I need to keep my VPN on after I've downloaded the initial torrent file? Like does my VPN need to stay active while the physical files are being downloaded from peers?"
How long do I need to keep my VPN on?,If your torrent client is open and seeding then I would leave it on if not then you can turn it off but for me I usually leave it on all the time just because
How long do I need to keep my VPN on?,"First, use qbittorrent and bind to your VPN
Second, make sure to use port forwarding
Third, yes as long as you are up or downloading, you need to keep your VPN on. Most probably it is not the VPN slowing you down, but the torrenting. If it is the VPN it might not be proper configurated. You still could try to make use of split tunneling, but I am not sure how wise that would be.``"

How long do I need to keep my VPN on?,">Do I need to keep my VPN on after I've downloaded the initial torrent file?

No, as long as it isn't seeding and you've cleared it from the queue to make sure it doesn't start up again

>Like does my VPN need to stay active while the physical files are being downloaded from peers?

Yes, it it's downloading/leeching or uploading/seeding you should have your VPN on. Honestly if I have anything in my queue I keep the VPN on regardless of it's status, but that might just be my paranoia talking.

It might be best to queue up the stuff you want to download and let it run while you sleep (assuming you've bound the VPN to the torrent client and trust your VPN to stay connected/have a working kill switch). That way you don't have to deal with any performance impacts from either the VPN or the torrents themselves and it's (hopefully) done running when you wake up."
How long do I need to keep my VPN on?,"1) get a better vpn. you shouldn't notice a difference in general browsing if you have a vpn with good servers.

2) get a vpn with split tunneling so you can only enable the vpn on applications that you want, like your torrent app."

"Can a """"free"""" VPN be as safe and effective as a paid one? How do you convince people that torrenting with a VPN isn't something they should fear?","This is the first time I have posted here, but I've had debates on this subject and others related to safe pirating (as well as the """"moral"""" conundrum behind it) for ages. Where I'm from, most types of content piracy are not expressly illegal and can only affect people selling bootlegs or downright stealing data. We've even had a case of a big international company suing a local shop for using their brand name, and they LOST the case here, so piracy isn't even remotely viewed as a problem.

&#x200B;

Still, I've been making more and more trips to London for work for the past two years, and I'm trying to use torrent sites as little as possible there and only use a free VPN when I do (or use VPN + Stremio). My colleagues here are mostly indifferent or even judgemental over piracy. Still, those who are curious about torrent films and games themselves are too afraid as they don't think their privacy or security is guaranteed even with a VPN.

&#x200B;

As far as I know, even free services offer secure and fast connections, even if your options are limited, and sometimes you have a data limit. To be safe, I employ my old laptop for streaming (football, UFC) and torrents, and I use [Thunder VPN for windows 7](

&#x200B;

With the recent resurgence of torrenting, especially for films and shows, due to the overabundance of streaming services (most of which suck), it's becoming easier and easier to recommend people to stream or pirate media, even though some of the younger people here seem to be wary of piracy.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: How to convince people that are afraid of using torrents that doing so with a VPN is safe? Are free VPN services just as safe, or should I beware of less secure ones that could get me in trouble in another country?"
"Can a """"free"""" VPN be as safe and effective as a paid one? How do you convince people that torrenting with a VPN isn't something they should fear?","Free vpn services arent safe for multiple reasons.

1. They have no Obligation to protect you , your not a paying customer.
2. They WILL sell data from you be it your websites visits, searches , keywords , what websites you visit they will.
3. Maintaining a safe and uptodate VPN service is expensive and needs work
4. Setting a VPN good and data protective up is hard.
5. Even reputable paid VPN have 100% cashback deals which make them ""free"" i would rather use those than a ratty 100% vpn which uses you.
6. a Vpn could theoretically inject data / change the data they transmit making MITM attacks possible.
7. some Free VPN are p2p networks and use your connection as exit point ( example Hola )

PrivateVPN reliability on Socks5?,"My NordVPN subscription is expiring and I'm looking for a replacement, almost purely for torrents. I use a Socks5 proxy with qBittorrent so the rest of my browsing isn't impacted. 

I've found with Nord that their Socks5 servers are really unreliable... they'll just stop working and I have to monitor it see if my torrents are still working or not, and when they're not, I need to manually change the server in my settings until I find one that is working. I'm looking for something where I can set the server in qBittorrent and just leave it without worrying about if it's actually up or not.

PrivateVPN looks like a good deal now with Socks5 support at $2/month for long-term plans. Is it a good choice?"

Step 1: Call the ISP and complain. Deny any knowledge of what a torrent is. Tell them you had a computer virus during that time and maybe the virus was doing something. Or possibly a hacker. But you have now re-installed your computer OS and there is no more virus/hacker/etc. And you discovered your wireless router had no password and your neighbors were stealing your wifi. Promise that your computer and wireless router are now secured.

Step 2: Beg and demand for your internet back. 

Step 3: If they refuse and say the ban is permanent, get internet from a different ISP.

Step 4: If there is no other provider for your address, try opening a [Spectrum Business account]( under a business name. You probably don't need an actual business filed with the state. Make up a business name and tell them it's a sole proprietorship.

Step 5: If all else fails, try to get internet under the name of someone else in your household, and if that person is asked about you, have them say that you moved out.

And in the future don't torrent on your own IP address. Switch to Usenet and/or use a VPN to protect yourself in the future."

"I got my first warning from Spectrum about copyright infringement. I immediately stopped all acts of illegal pirating, but couple weeks later they suspended my internet.

You have to tell them that the person is no longer visiting and that you have changed your wifi password and have taken every step that you can manage to re-secure your network and prevent something like that from happening again.

They will then likely connect you to or arrange an appointment to speak with their security/fraud department where someone else will go over what steps you have taken to prevent it or any ""rogue"" users from doing it again. The security/fraud department will then re-enable your service.

Source: I've personally dealt with this Spectrum in this manner.

edit: Reports of torrenting tend to trickle in and are not submitted in real time. You can have abuse reports weeks after the actual event.  It doesn't matter how long after the fact - you will still get the strike. When dealing with Spectrum in particular, you have to acknowledge with them that you saw the notice about the strike and that you are taking steps to mitigate the issue. You can't ignore repeat/multiple strikes with them -  they will, as you have experienced, disable your service. The only way to get it back on is to contact them and acknowledge what is happening. You don't have to admit guilt. But you have to acknowledge the strike and that you are doing something about it."

You call customer service and they give you a verbal warning (Make sure you deny doing anything and had no idea this was going on and for good measure ask them how you can prevent other from doing that kind of stuff in the future.

A little new to torrenting so sorry if this is a dumb question, but thanks a lot !

"
How Do Seeds/Peers Work + Corrupted Files ?,"The seeds and peers add up to 100 connections. It’s perfectly fine to have more seeds than peers, seeds are people who have 100% of the file and they’re sharing it to you, peers are people like yourself who are downloading the torrent"
How Do Seeds/Peers Work + Corrupted Files ?,"Well you have 71 seeds and 29 peers, together that makes a 100 connections. 

Missing file usually happens when the files got moved from it's original directory. While unpacking the files, you probably moved, deleted, or renamed something. You can right-click on the torrent and select 'set directory' to tell qBittorrent where the files are now. Remember it has to be in it's original state just like you downloaded it."
AirVPN issues,"I've been using airvpn for about 2 years now. Over the last 6-9 months it's been harder and harder to find servers that don't slow down to a crawl after 24 hours or less.

Is there anything I can do to speed it up or should I just try to find a good holiday deal with another company during the upcoming Christmas season?

How often do people get sued after their ISP gives out the warning?,"I got my second ISP warning in 2 years. The second time with VPN connected.

I'm kinda freaking out that I might get sued now that I've been flagged twice. Does it happen often? I'm in Canada where recently they got more tuff on things like this."
How often do people get sued after their ISP gives out the warning?,It's unlikely. Just make sure you have the VPN bound to qbittorrent and you shouldn't have any issues from now on. I have a pc dedicated to seeding and I've never gotten a notice because I keep the VPN bound to the program.

How often do people get sued after their ISP gives out the warning?,"In most likely scenarios, your ISP will close your account after a certain amount of warnings. Your information is typically not sent from your isp to other companies. Other companies file in complaints with your isp that your IP was downloading their content, they’re pretty much just relaying the message, but they can’t allow you to keep doing that continuously."

Is it normal to have slow download speed with PIA?,"I have a 50Mb/s download speed with my ISP. But after I connect to a vpn, the speed is now 20Mb/s. It doesn't matter which server I choose.

Proper Homelab setup for VPN.,"So I just got my internet cutoff for mass torrenting without a VPN (very stupid I am aware) so while I switch to a new provider I wanted to fix my setup so that this is very unlikely to happen in the future.

My setup is that I had Sonarr,Radarr,qBitTorrent and Jackett, all running in separate docker containers connected by a docker network. All of this was running on a headless Ubuntu 22 server.

I heard Bullvad is the go to VPN for this so now I am a little confused as to what is the proper way to connect everything.

Here are my questions:

1) Is it only the qBittorrent that needs to be hidden behind the VPN or do Sonarr, Raddar, and Jackett have to be hidden too?

2) Should Bullvad be running normally as a systemd service or inside a Docker container?

3) What is the best internal configuration for Bullvad for safe(in terms of ISP crackdown) downloading/uploading?

VPN only for qBittorrent,Better is to just run the VPN and qBittorrent in a virtual machine. Could also go the Docker route. Binhex makes Docker containers with VPN and various torrent clients combined.
VPN only for qBittorrent,Very useful docker container for that! 
VPN only for qBittorrent,Split tunneling is the solution. Virtual machines are too much overhead for something so easy. Docker is hell on earth and sucks on Windows.
VPN only for qBittorrent,"Under qBittorrent > Settings > Connection you can put in details for a proxy connection. Tick both boxes for peers and torrents.

So if your VPN offers a SOCKS proxy you can put that in there and then never bother with a VPN if you don't need it outside of qB.

But for the record, if you do this a lot... get a NAS box and dockers, it's way better."

​If you're not using qBittorrent get it.

Mullvad is the favorite around here, but what you really need to check is the trial period.  Get one, test it, and get a refund if it doesn't work.  Your ISP (university) can absolutely block VPNs if they want, and the easiest way is to block specific endpoints (i.e. the VPN servers).

The way torrenting works is that EVERYONE downloading the same file can see everyone else's IP Address.

For a VPN to protect you, ALL your traffic to the torrent swarm has ALWAYS go through the VPN. And the VPN has to not keep track of who used which IP Addresses. The VPN disconnects for 5 seconds, you are caught. Kill switches fail. Bind your torrent client to VPN. See the pinned post at the top of the sub. 

I know nothing about the VPN you named.  But it isn't your ISP that is looking.  If ISPs were looking for torrenting, then torrenting wouldn't work, because everyone and every server is connected to an ISP."

Is ProtonVPN free version safe,You can't use ProtonVPN free for torrenting
Is ProtonVPN free version safe,"[To do this, log in to your account at account.protonvpn.com, click the Upgrade button at the top right of the screen, and select your preferred plan.](

it doesn't look like you can torrent with their free vpn"
Is ProtonVPN free version safe,"Yes, it is safe but torrenting is blocked."
Is ProtonVPN free version safe,No logging policy doesn't mean shit. Besides they still have to collect some logs. If you can I would get mullvad as its 5€/month
Is ProtonVPN free version safe,"ProtonVPN has a free tier where they don't sell your data (… more than any other tier). Plus subscribers are able to use to free servers too.

But the free tier doesn't support p2p, maybe because when torrenting there are large amounts of data transferred, or because they don't want people to use their service for illegal activities with nothing in return."
Is ProtonVPN free version safe,"I trust it.

Torrenting is only allowed via paid subscriptions, however.

Windscribe can give you up to 15GB free every month, and allows P2P.

AdGuard also has a plan, this of 5GB free every month, but I am unsure about P2P.  
I usually use a Free VPN from the Chrome Webstore or Edge Extension Store. Mainly, Zenmate, but I am currently trying out CyberGhost for the first time in years."

ISP throttling torrent traffic with a VPN?,"I'm downloading Ubuntu via torrent, and I noticed I was getting really slow speeds, so I did a test.

I checked my internet speed with the torrent paused, and got 70mbps. Then, I limited my torrent client download speed to 100kbps, resumed the download, and did the speed test again. It registered 2mbps. If I pause the torrent, my speed shoots right back up to 70mbps. I did this a dozen times, it is consistent as clockwork. 

I am using ProtonVPN, I have DNSLeak protection enabled, I even have encryption forced in my torrent client. It's clear my ISP is doing some traffic analytics to detect torrent traffic without being able to see the traffic, so is there any way around this?"

I Need help with this situation.,"Hello I am new to the forum, but I need some help with this situation. I am changing my stuff to another system from a previous one. Let me explain the situation:

I built a new computer with windows 11 and went to install qbittorrent . Had no issues.  I have ExpressVPN for my vpn, (and it has been reliable and had no problems with speed and stability). I forwarded my ports on my Asus router (and confirmed that my port is open). I bound qbittorrent to my VPN (the option said ""Ethernet2"". When I went to the ipleak:8000 page, or any other torrent address checker (which I always do to check my connection before every torrenting session), I could not connect at all - the magnet file was stuck.  I checked my ip address; dns leak test; and webWRTC for the location that I am using to confirm that I am anonymous, and all confirmed that the vpn was working. I then went to use an ubuntu download for a test torrent, and that was stalled. These are the settings that I have previously used in my last machine. but this time it wont work. I then went to disconnect my vpn and tried to download the ubuntu torrent file again. Same result: stalled.   For years, I have been using utorrrent and qbittorrent with out any connection issues.  Wham I doing wrong here?   None of the ideas on the web works. I believe that I have done everything correct in the install, and binding, but something is wrong in one of the processes. I sent the last part of five hours on this, and nothing works."
I Need help with this situation.,ExpressVPN doesn't support port-forwarding. Choose a better VPN for torrenting.
I Need help with this situation.,"I give up.  

Tried reinstalling, no connection.  I don't know what happened with something that I have been successful with for years..  All the test torrents or the magnet from ipleak just wont connect.  My firewalls are the same setting. Its like something somewhere is blocking it. I just don't know what happened. I've followed the instructions of some on the net, but I need help!!!!"
I Need help with this situation.,There are two kinds of port forwarding. This one doesn’t go in the router. It goes in qbits network preference.

I Need help with this situation.,"I also have a side question. I can't tell what adapter that my vpn uses. I have ""ethernet"" and ""ethernet2"".  But I'm not sure because they won't drop off the list when connecting and disconnecting. I know that older versions of Windows let you what adapters are visible and in use, but I can't figure it out in Windows 11.  Maybe that is one off the problems? The frustrations is setting in and I have spent several hours trying to solve this."
I Need help with this situation.,"If you're using a VPN, port forwarding on your router won't do anything. You need to port forward from the VPN."

I Need help with this situation.,Port forwarding? Not [too]( sure
I Need help with this situation.,"Now I've encountered new problems.  I cant find an adapter to bind.  Since ExpressVPN uses the Lightway protocol, it uses the TUN adapter instead of both the TAP and the TUN.  I have several choices, which the obvious ones do not work:

1. Any Interface
2. Ethernet (my main connection)
3. Ethernet 2 (which is the broken Express VPN adapter)
4. WiFi
5.  Local Area Connection
6. Local Area Connection 2
7. Bluetooth Connection
8. Loopback Pseudo Interface                                          

The connection shows that I'm on Local Area Connection 4.  That does not show up on the list to bind to.  What do I do now?

I will uninstall and reinstall the VPN to see if the adapter changes."
I Need help with this situation.,"PROBLEM SOLVED!!!

I uninstalled and reinstalled the VPN. Found the ""Local Area Connection"" that Express VPN uses. (there were three Local Area Connections, but the one that was good was the one that did not have the number next to it.  Bound the VPN; went to IPLeak to check the addresses. Under the torrent address tab, the proper address for the country I am using works, along with the port that I am using. I went to also check the Web RTC Leak test and the DNS Leak test. All works fine.

This was an ordeal, but know I know that when I build a new system, hopefully I will remember this process."

If your VPN will allow you to extract/export the necessary credentials to set up Tunnelblick, you could try that. When I’ve used tunnelblick, the network interface doesn’t change in the same way, IIRC. 

Otherwise it may be necessary to just get in the habit of running ifconfig in the terminal before you fire up qbit."

Nord creates a different network interface (NI) for each protocol, i.e., NordLynx vs. IKEv2 vs. OpenVPN (UDP) vs. OpenVPN (TCP). I always use NordLynx, and my experience is that the NI (utun2) doesn't change.

Edit: Have you recently changed/deleted etc. some other app that had created a network interface? For example, Adguard and Little Snitch are utun0 and utun1 on my Mac. If I deleted one of those, macOS would probably reassign the NI designations so NordLynx would no longer be utun2."

Best VPN for Japanese Netflix?,"> the best speed for Japan (connecting from USA)? There's some games I want to get around geoblocks too

The only sure way is to try them out. Theres no simple answer because you want the VPN server to not be overwhelmed *and* to have a good internet routing between your ISP and the VPN server.

Just wondering if anyone knows any solutions to install URBVPN. I keep getting the foillowing error when the installer tries to complete:

I came on this sub and saw everyone recommending Mullvad so I swapped over and have really enjoyed it. My question is if Mullvad connects to their network differently which would allow it to work at places such as my hospital that are intentionally trying to prevent people from connecting to VPNs. If they connect the same, is there anything in the settings I can change to possibly make it work?

I am working all day tomorrow and I just want to be able to watch the damn games on my laptop haha. Any advice is seriously appreciated."
Hospital preventing my VPN from connecting,When I have been at the hospital I usually connect with TCP. You can also try different ports if you need to try more stuff. If your VPN has anyways to go passed firewalls you can try that as well.

I have the same setup and I routinely check iknowwhatyoudownload.com and for years it has been empty. I also used to check the binding was still there after qBittorrent and VPN client updates, but tbh I already forget sometimes since it always checked out. 

The only other thing you could consider would be having a qBittorrent docker, but I feel it would be overkill just for the safety concern. Downloading only from reputable private trackers might help too."

Enable port-forwarding, it'll make quite a significant difference for these kind of torrents. That's where your speed issue is coming from.

Best or good free torrenting vpn?,"This has probably been asked many times before here, but the examples that I have found on this sub where people are asking about free torrenting vpns aren't necessarily what I am looking for, or are just absurdly unrealistic for a free vpn.

VPN review sites online are sorta helpful but only to a point.

From knowledge of, or from experience with, what are your ""best"" recommendations for free vpns I can use for torrenting with reliable security? Speed isn't necessarily an issue for me, but obviously faster speeds are always welcome.

Preferably with a data limit no smaller than 500MB *per day*, or at least 2GB *per month*. I don't do much torrenting and limit isn't necessarily an issue, but a few things I've downloaded in the past were indeed larger than a single gig.

I do not mind if the vpn needs me to sign up/create an account/whatever.

Thanks in advance."

PSA: Do NOT use WeVPN - Warrant Canary tripped,"[

**Screenshot as of October 4th / 5th 2022:** [

WeVPN assures of an update to a canary ""once per month"". However, as of today (October 4th / 5th 2022), the canary has been updated till ""1st August 2022"". 

This means that there has been no declaration for the **entire month of September 2022** and **more than 60 days have passed** since we last heard from the WeVPN team regarding the Warrant Canary. 

**Their warrant canary has tripped, meaning that they have been trying to warn their users that they are under a gag order.**

WeVPN seems to be compromised. 

This isn't a first in the consumer VPN industry. VPN-Secure had its Warrant Canary trip too. More about that here: ["

Really? No, your ISP can't see what is on your PC. 

If you're not using qBittorrent get it. 

​Bind qBittorrent to your VPN. This stops all torrent traffic if your VPN drops it's connection or you forgot to connect. It's more reliable than a Kill Switch. 

In qBittorrent, go to Settings > Advanced > Network interface and select your VPN interface.

If you don't know which is your VPN, disconnect it and see which interface disappears.

Can I safely turn off VPN after downloading initial torrent file?,"I’m a novice bear with me.

Situation: [phase 1] so you go to a torrent site, download a torrent file. It’s saved in your downloads, you open the torrent file in your ‘torrent downloading client’ and [phase 2] it starts downloading the actual torrent (movie or whatever). 

Question: is the torrent in phase 2 still being downloaded from the internet? Or now from a local file on your computer. Thus do you need your VPN on still in phase 2? I’m asking because without vpn the downloading can be 10 or more x faster."
Can I safely turn off VPN after downloading initial torrent file?,"ISP (and copyright holders who submit notices to your isp) do not care about 1. They only care about 2. 

You can think of 1 as the phone number of a drug dealer, 2 is the actual drugs. 1 is the instructions that your torrent client uses to download the actual content files. You’re not going to get busted for having 1, only 2.  (1 is merely suspicious but not breaking any rules)

Make sure you bind your torrent client to your vpn connection first. 

I’d highly suggest reading more and learning more before you download any pirated content, Start with open source or public domain stuff like Linux distros so if you mess up you won’t have your isp breathing down your neck"
Can I safely turn off VPN after downloading initial torrent file?,"No.   
The risk is in phase 2 in fact.

“Without VPN x10 faster” It has not to be so. It depends on what you pay."
Can I safely turn off VPN after downloading initial torrent file?,You're downloading the files from peer connections and everyone can see your IP. Your torrent client should only be able to access the Internet through your VPN. The client should stop downloading if your VPN disconnects.

Any way to circumvent ISP throttling of VPN traffic?,"At least I assume what's going on here. ISP is Xfinity in The Peoples Republic of Illinois.

I just recently acquired Mullvad and thought the problem was at their end, but then tried Windscribe Pro and am seeing similar results. Tests are from a hardwired desktop PC running Windows 10. Speedtest Windows app locked to same Speedtest server in same city as I have set the VPN to target.

I've tried changing destination cities for VPN, disabling multi-hop, lowering MTU on Wireguard, nothing has any meaningful positive impact.

Any suggestions?

&#x200B;

EDIT/UPDATE: I heard back from Mullvad support WAY faster than I was expecting, so kudos to them for that. They recommended switching to OpenVPN with TCP and port 443, which produced considerable improvement, albeit extremely variable:

Run #1: 13ms, 492.76 down, 22.61 up

Run #2: 13ms, 339.85 down, 22.64 up

Any way to circumvent ISP throttling of VPN traffic?,"Mullvad - OpenVPN TCP 443 or WireGuard with bridge mode (Shadowsocks).

Yes you can, but in the Mullvad dashboard you need to unlink the port from any WireGuard key."
Any way to circumvent ISP throttling of VPN traffic?,"Although there're ways to still detect traffic on TCP 443 (a port used for HTTPS), it requires very expensive hardware (deep packet inspection). The fact you get 4x throughput after changing the port is a strong proof for throttling being in place. Kudos to you, there have been very few documented accounts of this quality.

With many VPNs port-forwarding is only available with OpenVPN, like only few support PF with Wireguard. Yes you can."

Speeds are maybe like 6-10mbps etc. (directly downloading to MacBook then manual transfer to NAS/Plex server. 

I’m aware that there’s a lot of factors that dictate speeds and so many preferences it can be overwhelming. Been doing this for many years and I’m kind of a perfectionist, don’t wanna miss out on what my setup is capable of doing. 

Side note (Nvidea shield pro effortlessly plays anything I throw at it. By far the best device on the market. And that’s coming from an Apple fanboys perception). 

Any advice on speeds? My speed tests hardwired connected to VPN are roughly 200-300mps. Not connected to VPN is obviously consistently 950+. 

Thanks"
Proper VPN/torrent client configuration for speeds,Switch to WireGuard and enable port-forwarding. Connect to closest uncongested servers.
Proper VPN/torrent client configuration for speeds,"Since, you have this insane gigabit connection.

Please, switch I2P plugin ON in BiglyBT torrent client.

As I2P network helps in anonymous torrenting.

This will be benificial for I2P users who are downloading same torrents as you."
Proper VPN/torrent client configuration for speeds,"I use mullvad VPN and depending on the server I get almost the full gigabit down and the 200mbps up, in terms of setup I run qBitTorrent with the Vue web ui in UNRAID and the qBitTorrent comes with a wireguard VPN builtin that I configure with the mullvad server.

Max download speed I saw was around 70MB/s with a Linux iso and most of the films/series download between 4 to 50MB/s.

My favorite so far is the Usenet with max download speeds of 100MB/s
Average download speed should be around 50MB/s or more.

Since I setup this server one year ago I have passed the 100TB uploaded."

That's the limit for OpenVPN and current hardware. OpenVPN just isn't very efficient due to unavoidable processing overhead."
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,"Just tried out Mullvad and it seems to be fine, but I only want to use VPN for qbitorrent and nothing else but Mullvad spit tunnel only allows for the opposite (everything is on VPN by default and you can exclude programs).

Any other good VPNs that allow for this? I did look at this [post] ( of recommended VPNs but I'm not sure if any of them have this feature. 

Also, I just want this feature for convenience but would it be ""more unsafe"" if I were to do this?"
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,It's easier to use a Docker container for qbtorrent and vpn. The end result is the same and it's simpler
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,PIA is the only one. I didn't even know Mullvad had it. I use PIA and totally love the reverse split. Everything bypasses the VPN except for qbit and prowlarr.
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,I used [this]( guide to route Deluge through Mullvad with port forwarding.
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,"You can do inverse split tunneling with Mullvad, search their support page. Alternatively docker.

Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,The way to do this safely is to use Docker VPN and qBittorrent containers.
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,ProtonVpn allows this option
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,"PIA seems to be the only one that supports it. I've contacted Mullvad support requesting inverse split tunneling but the idea was shot down and they seem reluctant to ever add it. 

ProtonVPN does this and it supposedly works fine with the OpenVPN protocol however enabling port forwarding for Wireguard is extremely buggy and I could never get it to work."
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,Proton VPN or PIA.
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,Isn't it better to do this via Firewall Rules?
Mullvad alternatives that have inverse split tunneling,If you have an old computer stick a bigger hard drive in it and use vpn and Qbit on that pc. No need to split tunnel and you can get a cheaper vpn.
Opening Port,How can I open my port? I cannot seed because of it. I do use a VPN.
Opening Port,"If you are using a VPN then you need a provider that does port forwarding.  VPN use means opening a port for the torrent client does not have anything to do with your router.

&#x200B;

A VPN is used to tunnel from the VPN client to the VPN server, this tunnel passes through your router as encrypted traffic to the VPN server.  At the server end it is decrypted and put on the internet for the destination."

Free VPN’s?,"I’m currently in Sweden and I need to access some websites that I could see from home (USA) for work. Is there a free vpn I can use for this? I don’t know much about these but I know I can look like I’m in a different country with one, right?"
Free VPN’s?,"Windscribe - 10GB a month for free on signup, I used a promo code and now have 30GB a month."
Free VPN’s?,"I Guess you can try proton vpn there is no data cap on its free servers, which include 3 countries netherland america and japan. Speeds are not that bad and only disadvantage is torrenting is not possible on the free servers and one device at a time limit. If you just need a vpn with free American servers i think proton vpn is great option"
Free VPN’s?,"Try ProtonVPN.

It has a limited free plan with servers in the USA."
Free VPN’s?,"i don't know if you want free when it come to VPN. VPN is about trust, right? you trust the VPN provider not to sell your info/traffic or do something with it. VPN cost money thus if its free then how  provider fund its operation (?)."
Free VPN’s?,I use proton vpn. It has fast speed and no cap. If you want extra security I use Hotspot VPN (has a data cap on desktop but not on phones 5 Mbps) and I use Speedtest VPN (has a cap only mobile 5 Mbps)
Free VPN’s?,"Wouldn't recommend using free ones because if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product. With that said, if free is what you want, you can check out ProtonVPN and Windscribe. If you want faster speeds or no data cap, you can search for 6 month codes of VPN Unlimited (that's the name of the VPN).
If you're an advanced user and are comfortable with Linux, you can use something like DigitalOcean or Linode (you'll get $100 or something worth of credits valid for 2 months). You can set up a VPS by choosing a US location and then host OpenVPN or Wireguard on that server. It'll be your very own VPN server. The whole thing will take less than an hour if you're familiar with it. Otherwise, paying for a VPN like Mullvad is just easier and better."
Free VPN’s?,"You could try Tor. There supposedly is a way to tell it which country to use for your exist node, but you would need to google it, I don't know how offhand. 

Windscribe has a free package, but the server locations are limited and there is a small data cap. ProtonVPN also has a free package. 

And there is the VPN run by the RiseUp Collective. They have been around for 20 years, and seem legit. But you still run a risk with them. Be sure to only visit HTTPS web sites. Their VPN gets quite slow at times.  

And there is VPNGate, run by a university in Japan. Volunteers run it's exit nodes, which means that some are just PCs in bedrooms or whatever. Very dodgy, but might be useful depending on your need and level of desperation.

Edit: "
Free VPN’s?,If something is free then most of the time you are the product.

Free VPN’s?,"just use a cracked account, its also so annoying how people call free vpns ""unsafe"" it misleads new vpn users into thinking they have to pay to be secure.  free vpn plans like protonvpn, windscribe, and tunnelbear have free plans but are safe and dont sell your data"

Tips to avoid being tracked by ISP?,"Recently torrented the newest episode of House of the Dragon, and my landlord sent 2 emails reporting that our ISP noticed it while I was using our home wifi. I'm currently looking into a VPN such as Mullvad, but I'm still not sure about the process. 

Do I just get the VPN, turn it on, download my torrent, then turn it off? and whilst I still use the home wifi, the ISP should theoretically not be able to see that I'm torrenting, correct? 

Also, does using incognito mode or various web browsers make any differences?

Thanks"
Tips to avoid being tracked by ISP?,"Use a VPN while qBittorrent is opened. For using torrent without fear, there is a guide here: [

Your ISP will know nothing when you use a VPN.

You can have VPN turn on as much as you want. There is no problem here.

Incognito mode nothing to do here. Incognito mode is only to don't record anything you do in your browsing history. Your browsing history only could be accesible for anyone who reach your PC (family and friends)."
Tips to avoid being tracked by ISP?,There is a stickied post at the top of this community. Most important thing is you need to bind your torrent client to your VPN adapter.

How does a VPN work for streaming videos even after disconnecting it after the video starts?,"When accessing a streaming website which is not available in your location, you can use a VPN to start the video and disconnect it. The video will stream without VPN and even with improved speed. So how does it work?"
How does a VPN work for streaming videos even after disconnecting it after the video starts?,"The web site where you authenticate and select what to stream is not where the video stream itself comes from. For instance, Netflix web site runs in AWS (or at least used to), but they have a huge extensive network of cache servers (Google ""Netflix Open Connect"").  Other streamers contract the content deliver hassles out to someone else. A server complex that works well for a web site is quite a different design than one that works well for streaming. 

If you run Wireshark before connecting to the streamer's web site you would be able to see all the different IP Addresses your device communicates with to get a stream started. Also look up the term ""session cookies"". 

Look up the term ""Content Delivery Network"".  Reddit uses a CDN named Fastly - what you see on your screen doesn't come directly from a Reddit server in AWS in California, it comes from a nearby Fastly server. There are many CDNs, Akamai was the first.  Disney for example uses 3 or 4 of the big CDNs, not just one.  The big cloud providers have a limited number of huge data centers each, the CDNs spread the load across 100-150 ""points of presence"" (POP)."
How does a VPN work for streaming videos even after disconnecting it after the video starts?,"I don't see the point, very bad VPN has to be. I mean, streaming doesn't require an incredible internet speed, and almost all VPNs are able to exceed that speed.

If you don't want to use the VPN in the whole system, use split tunneling."
PIA and UTorrentWEB,"Title pretty much says all, I have all my PIA settings set properly and accordingly however is it safe to torrent using utorrentweb alongside? I have no split tunnels, just run PIA 24/7 Killswitch etc etc all enabled"
PIA and UTorrentWEB,I don't see why you should use uTorrentWeb when you can use qBittorrent (a free and open source program).

Got a question about Mullvad safety.,"So I'm not new to torrenting but I never used VPNs before. I usually didn't torrent mainstream movies and just used direct download from a forum I'm in that uploads stuff to mega. I paid 5 bucks a month for higher download limits but they terminated my account for Copyright violation (have no idea how I got caught as I never uploaded or stored copyrighted material, only using direct download) So because I found it annoying to circumvent the download limit I just started torrenting off of LEET as I am not in any private trackers. I foolishly did not use a VPN.

So for the first time I got a letter in the mail about being caught torrenting, get this, Dreamworks Over the Hedge.

SO, I did some research and have bought a month of Mullvad to test it and I have set everything up.

Now here comes my question finally. Essentially the letter said it was a warning Yada Yada Yada and that if I get caught again they would cut off the internet. MY ISP how a monopoly on this area so I have zero alternatives if that happens.
So, my question comes down to, has anyone been caught while using Mullvad. If anyone has, I don't think I wanna take the risk.

OR if it's possible I've been flagged considering I've gotten caught once already and they Might monitor me more closely

Edit: torrenr client is already bond to Mullvad!"
Got a question about Mullvad safety.,"> uploaded or stored copyrighted material,

That isn't how copyright law works, the server sent you an illegal copy of a protected work, period. Doesn't matter if you stored it or not, it was the act of sending it to you that broke the law. If you walk up to a drug dealer and buy something and immediately flush it down a toilet, you still broke the law, right? 

The #1 rule of thumb is DO NOT DEPEND ON KILL SWITCHES.  They fail. It only takes SECONDS of your real IP Address to show up in a torrent swarm to get caught. Bind your torrent client to the VPN network interface:



Also, it isn't your ISP ""monitoring"" you. They don't give a fuck about copyrights, and they have NO LEGAL POSITION when the copyright is owned by someone else. All they can do is enforce their terms of service. Copyright trolls work for the copyright owner as their ""agent"", monitor torrent swarms, and send notices to the ISP who forwards them to you. Everyone in a torrent can see the IP Addresses of everyone else. If you got caught downloading from the direct download or pirate streaming site, it means that the copyright owner got their fingers directly into that site - it wasn't your ISP."
Got a question about Mullvad safety.,"Kill switch can fail (1% chance) and you can get caught (0.1% chance). 

Binding your qbittorrent... don't worry."
Got a question about Mullvad safety.,"mullvad drops sometimes but it's worth it for the Hugh security nature of the VPN

2. Download qbittorrent and bind your VPN to your torrent client under advanced settings

4. Download content

If you want to go the manual and tedious route downloading everything manually. Best site to use for movies and shows in general is rarbg. I dont watch anime so I don't know good sites for that but just look it up in the sonarr subreddit. Should be able to find info there

If you want to get a killer automated setup for grabbing content from any site you want download and install sonarr, radarr, jackett, plex media server, plex media player. This setup will basically act as a netflix like interface where you add shows and movies, and it will torrent them when they come out and automatically upgrade to higher qualities like bluray when they release. Takes a little bit to setup but it's totally worth it trust me. I have dozens of shows sonarr is monitoring right now and grabbing new episodes weekly. I have sonarr and radarr importing my watchlist from plex and trakt. So when I'm on my phone or something I'll add a new show to my trakt watchlist and next time I'm on my computer it will download automatically. Dont even need to open the programs just let them run and it imports everything to plex when its done. Check out this video for setting it up  The video is a little old but it's still mostly accurate. It's the tutorial I used when I set it up originally."

I thought I had this fixed when I added the Mullvad Listen Port to my Router settings, but now things seem worse.  Do I have all the ports in the right spots?  I also added DNS Servers from Mullvad.

MacOS Big Sur, QBittorrent 4.4.5, Mullvad VPN w/ Port Fwd, Wireguard app with Mullvad config file imported.

I could seed like mad, but a download would kill everything, even to the point where restarting the Mac was difficult as Id have to Pause QBT, then try to quit it, which of course is not easy. Then the Mac still didn't want to restart.  Anyway, just want to make sure I have all the Ports opened up and that they are the correct numbers in the correct spot.

So I deactivated my VPN connection while QBT was still up (not recommended) .  Waited about a minute, then Activated VPN again.  Immediately everything started seeding and downloading at full speed... Again, this was just one min or less after all downloads and seeds completely stopped responding.  Recycled the VPN connection and everything shot right back up."
QBittorrent / Mullvad stops all traffic if I start a download.,"I might have solved this one. Again, the issue was only when I started a Download.

Every once in a while, Id get a clue, and see a small Error in the GUI. An error that looked like it had trouble with the file. The drive I was saving to is a remote drive on a Mac mini.

So I told QBT to store the files \*locally\*, then move them when done.Check the box and set 'Use another path for incomplete torrents' <-- Pick a LOCAL drive/pathThe 'Default Save Path' does not need to change, and for me is the Remote Drive Path

I've since downloaded several files with 0 issues. Doing a 213 GB  file to really test.

Good Luck!"

1. so i am aware it is best to use a vpn while torrenting, and i am planning on qbittorent but what my main question is do i need to use a vpn on anything i download FROM whatever torrent i use? (also if this question seems stupid im completely new to all of this so please excuse this if i sound dumb rn lol...) also im planning on downloading games if that helps at all
2. what is the best torrent to use? from research it seems to be qbittorent or bittorent web but ofc im new to this and i could be wrong, and if i am wrong what is the better torrent to use?"

Having a VPN, use it always."

Hardware for Running a “Tunnel?”,"I don’t trust my ISP.  I’m trying to set up an “always on VPN” sometimes also referred to as a “tunnel VPN.”  In short, I want all traffic on my network except local traffic (printing, NAS) to be sent out through a VPN, without having to configure VPN software on each separate device.

For example, when my Switch automatically connects to my WiFi and tries to contact the Nintendo Store, I want it’s traffic to automatically be encrypted and it’s IP address obfuscated, even though I can’t install a VPN client directly on the Switch.  This is of course in addition to the usual BitTorrent traffic from my various computers!

I’m looking for recommendations on a new router to buy (or maybe a UTM) that would work well for this job.  Any recommendations?"
Hardware for Running a “Tunnel?”,"Here you go:

- MiniPC w/ 2 ethernet OR older APU-based PC w/ a PCIE ethernet card
- Whatever router you want, operating in a dumb mode, since you want wifi

There are a number of ""router OS"" options for the first element. Plug it directly into your modem. Plug the router into the PC. If you set up the PC for headless you'll do fine for maintenance, changing settings, later. 

OS options include VyOS, OpenWRT, DD-WRT, Advanced Tomato, & pfsense all off the top of my head. I don't know/remember the Ps&Cs of each sorry.  

Now you mention the reason for this is not trusting your ISP so you want all internet-bound traffic to go through the VPN. Two options here: cheap proxy node VPS w/ wireguard tunnel, or just a commercial VPN. Commercial VPN is more private/secure generally, but not *more so against your ISP* as your stated purpose.

If you're torrenting, go with a commercial VPN. Mullvad is golden.

If you're doing purely above-board stuff, go with a proxy node (less traffic on the node = better connection experience for you). 

Good luck."
What is a proxy and is it needed? When i torrent i use a vpn and have never gotten a strike.,"A proxy is not *needed* in most contexts, so let me try to help you out here:

A VPN is a proxy with extra steps.

At it's most basic level, a proxy is an external machine that you pass connections through. If you connect to site IP x.x.x.x with your home machine, it will see your y.y.y.y machine's external IP (usually your router's IP). If you are connecting to site x.x.x.x through a proxy, it will see the proxy z.z.z.z IP connect, *not* y.y.y.y. That's generally speaking *all* a proxy does. 

A VPN does the same thing and adds these additional steps.

* The connection between y.y.y.y. and z.z.z.z with a VPN is *encrypted* so unless there's an issue no one can read the traffic between the two points.
* The VPN exit-node (same as the proxy: z.z.z.z) is shared under a commercial VPN so lots of people use the same, so your traffic cannot be identified.
* A good VPN (like Mullvad) doesn't keep logs and allows you to pay anonymously, meaning they can't identify your traffic to 3rd parties. 

So why would you want to combine the two? Simply put, to make your security stronger and better. Do you *need* to? I don't know. I don't know your country; I don't know the legal consequences of torrenting in your country; I don't know how vulnerable you are otherwise; and I don't know what your personal risk acceptability & security preference algorithms/formulae are like. I'm not asking you to tell me, either.
 
Instead, I'm saying that this is **a decision for you to make based on your personal context.**

Are VPNs a waste of money?,"When it comes to downloading torrents, is it necessary to get one?"
Are VPNs a waste of money?,"In the USA yes, or something else that uses an IP Address not traceable to you. 

It must be a trusted, NO LOG VPN, preferabilty with a published independent audit. 

In a torrent swarm, everyone can see the IP Address of every downloader. So, the media owner just joins the swarm, collects IP Addresses, and sends a copyright notice to the owner of that IP Address. Everyone who owns IP Addresses must have a public abuse email address in the IP Address registry.  If the owner of that IP address has records of who that IP Address is assigned to or was used by, that notice gets sent to you. ISPs always know who had what IP Address when. No log VPN providers by definition do not know. 

And the media companies are pushing hard in the USA to make ISPs actually terminate service to repeat copyright violators.

And this sub has many reports of people receiving notices because their VPN failed and they didn't have their torrent client bound to the VPN."

Downloading onto a mapped network drive through a torrenting client," 

Hello, I am using qBittorrent with my network interface mapped to my VPN's wireguard connection so that all traffic is tunneled through my VPN. I have a local NAS that is not connected through a VPN and does not have torrent software installed. If I torrent a file directly onto the mapped network drive from my PC, will all traffic be tunneled to the NAS?

What about seeding? Will the torrent traffic go back through my PC to upload through the VPN? Or will it be unable to seed entirely?

Will the IP of the NAS ever leak, or are all connections to it tunneled through the VPN?"
Downloading onto a mapped network drive through a torrenting client,"QBittorrent just sees a mapped drive/folder as a regular directory on your local machine. The VPN binding only affects the connection to other peers and trackers, not local file operations."
Torrent speed throttled,It seems like my isp is lowering my downlink speed when i download torrents. I am using mullvad as recommended by a lot of people here and i did all the recommended steps but still have this issue. Does anybody have any idea what might be going on. Also no matter what i do i cant fix the dns leak issue. As i said my download speed was fine but all of the sudden it just completely died. No clue?? Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks in advance.
Torrent speed throttled,"If you're using a VPN, and have it set correctly, they can't tell if you are torrenting or not. AND, torrenting is a legitimate download method, even for things like Linux, so it's very unlikely they would throttle torrent traffic.

Be sure you have your torrent client bound to your VPN. You can't have a DNS leak if you do."

qBittorrent bound to VPN but still got copyright infringement notice,"So I just got a copyright infringement notice from my ISP for something I downloaded today. I've torrented a lot of stuff and most of it seems to go unnoticed, but this is actually my third warning so I must be doing something wrong.

&#x200B;

I use PIA and have a rule set up so that qBittorrent can only access the internet via VPN (I prefer not to use a VPN for my main browser because of all the annoying side effects like reCAPTCHAs). I have also configured qBittorrent to only work on the network interface that I use with my VPN. I also have the kill switch enabled on PIA which should theoretically prevent any data leakage.

&#x200B;

Despite all of this, I still received a notice today, and when I check [iknowwhatyoudownload.com]( it sees not only the content I was hit for today, but a few other things I've recently downloaded. Possibly of note is that this morning, I disconnected and reconnected my internet connection because it wasn't working.

&#x200B;

Does anybody have any idea why this is happening or what I can do to try and resolve it? I've tried searching around but everything I find just says to do what I've already done.

vpn vs wireguard,I use vpn so that my isp doesn't shut off my internet for torrenting. Does using wireguard or zeroteir work the same way.
vpn vs wireguard,"WireGuard is just a VPN protocol. You still need a VPN. You VPN may already have WireGuard as an option. 

The standard VPN protocol has been OpenVPN. WireGuard can be faster."
vpn vs wireguard,"Zeroteir is usually created to create a private LAN between devices.  Its considered better then hamachi cause ZT (zerotier) is both open sourced (so code audits can be done) and is true cross platform so literally anyone can join in the co-op/LAN play (Windows, Linux, Mac).

Wireguard is a newer VPN protocol that can be used for point to poin like ZT but it is much harder to setup for the average user compared to ZT when creating a LAN type setup.

For the scope of this reddit though Wireguard is \~30% faster then OpenVPN.  The 3 - 4 VPNs listed in the recommended thread here all have Wireguard with Mullvad being prob the first to adopt."
Seeding Not Working on VPN/Proxy :(,"Good Evening. 

I have a phone with the OVPN app and a proxy app. I first open the OVPN app then my proxy app and connect to my PC. I go to the OVPN website and under WireGuard, I open up port 59407. I then go to Bittorrent and enter the port but it gives me a port not open remark. I then go to yougetsignal website and enter my port 59407 and it says port closed. It download the videos but doesn't seed.

So, even though my phone is behind CG-NAT (using an undisclosed wireless provider), can I use a VPN that offers port-forwarding and still be able to seed torrents? Is my process missing something?

"How come you need a VPN to do torrenting but don't when using an app like ShowBox, that just streams films or downloading a game ROM? - I don't even fully know what torrenting is tbh","Copyright violation is something that generally has to be enforced by the copyright owner, such as Disney.  The way torrenting works, being peer-to-peer, EVERYONE in a specific torrent swarm can see all the IP Addresses of everyone else.  So Disney, or their agent, attaches to a swarm with special software that captures all the IP Addresses seen. Then it looks up the owner of the IP Address in the public database of IP Address owners, and sends them an DMCA email, and if it is an ISP, they forward it to you since they know what IP address they assigned to who. VPNs don't keep track of IP Addresses, so they can't forward it, and federal law (in the USA) shields them against whatever their users do. 

When you download from a web site, only the web site can associate your IP Address to what you downloaded. There is no way for a third party such as Disney to know what you did. 

In any case, it is a good idea to always use a trusted VPN when pirating, since a download web site could be a trap."

Could anyone help?"
Wireguard on docker stopped working,"It appears it deletes the wg0 network device.

I have ipv6 disabled in the stack.

I'm running Raspbian bullseye 11 and did an apt-update recently. Did something updated that no longer supports wireguard?"
TorGuard,What do people think of TorGuard?
TorGuard,I used it like 6 years ago and it was fine. Stopped using since I moved to seeedbox.
TorGuard,It’s great!
TorGuard,Why not just use mullvad its cheaper too and you don't need to sign up for a 2 year contract or smth
TorGuard,"I am a very happy customer of theirs and have been for multiple.....multiple years. I started off with TorrentPrivacy, then switched to PIA, then TorGuard as I had seen them advertised multiple times when looking up VPN's so I gave them a chance. As a matter of fact I use them with a couple other people and its been great. I don't think there is a single day, a single time i connect and don't double check my IP and test every connection...often re connecting multiple times out of paranoia.... to which i can say...happily that EVERY SINGLE CONNECTION has been secure. If your going after the most secure connection you can, than I recommend AES-256,  A port# that supports SHA512, VPN-DNS(as TorGuard has Logless DNS, I know this cause I asked a few hours ago), KillSwitch Enabled, and App-Kill for certain programs, lol( this means when TorGuard is dosconnected certain programs will COMPLETELY close out on top of the KillSwitch in place. NO OTHER VPN OFFERS THIS)... as well as using DHCP-CloudFlare in the settings. 

I email and bother customer support almost daily with random questions... and I can honestly tell you this VPN is ROCK SOLID. 

Again, you don't have to re-connect like I do.... paranoia and being OCD are part of me. This VPN WILL keep you safe. I have debated whether or not I wanna try PIA though (They use 10GB-SERVERS: EVERY server) but again that is me being curious... also PIA has been proven in court a couple times to keep NO LOGS, as well against against a court case with the FBI and won. Torguard ahs not been audited yet, PIA HAS though and been proven multiple time's over with their NO-LOGS policy.

I have also looked into Express VPN and Nord but their rather expensive for what they offer.... PIA/Torguard offer way better deals and more for the $$ in the long term if you ask me. 

The only thing at this point that makes me curious about Private Internet Access is that ALL of their Servers are again 10GB rated and you can use them for streaming, and also from what I have read... PIA offers the strictest NO LOGS VPN Policy I have read yet.... and believe me, I have spent HOURS, DAYS WEEKS researching this all out. 

&#x200B;

I hope this helps a little."
TorGuard,"I recently started using it. I was going to purchase a month to give it a try, however I accidentally bought multiple services. My total ended up being close enough to the cost of a year subscription so customer service was kind enough to merge all these accounts into a year subscription. So far my impressions is good. There is fewer server locations then some services out there. Fur be that's no big deal because I don't need a server in any specific area. For whatever reason for me using openvpn is faster than wire guard, no idea why because no other service is like that for me. Speed is great, I have been able to get torguard to beat surfshark pia nord and one other service I can't remember at the moment with surfshark coming in a close second. Hope this helps"
TorGuard,"It works well, and their support is good, at least in my view. Have some downsides like they have fewer servers than others and aren't quick to add many more if that's any issue for you."
TorGuard,Had them for around 4 years now and it is been fine. I mostly use Mullvad because torguard still doesn't have split tunneling on Windows but if you don't need that it's fine. App feels a bit slow and clunky compared to others I've tried but it's decent value for what it costs.
TorGuard,"I had them for years. I only dropped them for WeVPN because I mainly use my Android Box. For some reason, Torguard on any of my Android TV boxes would have a hell of a time trying to connect. I just got frustrated and left them. On Windows, it worked great. Great speed, good help, just at that time, not good with TV boxes. That might have changed by now. They have a 7-day free trial. If you don't like them, there's Mullvad, and I'm very happy with WeVPN."

Windscribe or Mullvad?,"I currently pay for Mullvad (~£4.50 GBP) per month. 
i am considering getting windscribe for ($3) per month, because all i need is Netherlands and UK servers (with unlimited traffic) and they do that for less. 
Is it worth sticking with mullvad for the extra features?
I use VPN to:
torrent on my old laptop (like a personal seed box), stream using kodi and unblock my school wifi."
Windscribe or Mullvad?,"IMO, No, either will do what you want just fine. I've had both and had no issue, just be sure to check your school Wi-Fi on their free plan, as all schools are different"
Windscribe or Mullvad?,The only great extra feature to me is Mullvad's split-tunneling. They wrote the driver and everything themselves and published the code for everyone.

MullVad port forwarding help,I have been using BitTorrents for a while but never with a VPN until recently. I got MullVad (switched from Express because of this Reddit) but when I tried port forwarding on qBittorent it keeps not working (the port is never open).. I tried following the steps on MullVads website but I’m a little confused I guess. Can anyone give me a quick guide or step by step run down to get it working? Thanks!
MullVad port forwarding help,"Assuming you're using Windows, and assuming you're trying to **bind** Mullvad to QB (which you should do).... did you open the port?  If not, see my post towards the bottom of this thread (it fixed OPs similar/same problem):

There is also a video in that thread from u/daiqo, which was helpful to me as well when I initially set mine up, but I still had to complete this additional step to make it all work correctly (and it is not shown in the video, at least the last time I watched it)."
MullVad port forwarding help,Did you create a firewall rule for the port?
MullVad port forwarding help,I finally figured it out.. I created the port on MullVad and then made qBittorrent use that port.. then I had to go into my firewall and allow the port (added it as a “rule” in advanced settings) then I allowed “edge traversal” in the rule settings for the port and at first it still wasn’t showing as “reachable” even though I checked to make sure the port was being listened for… so I shut down my PC and restarted my internet and turned everything back on and BAM! the port is reachable and working on my torrent client. Thanks everyone I really appreciate the help! I was starting to give up on it lol.
Torrent has leechers but my client won't seed,"I use LibreTorrent on Android and Mullvad VPN. I made sure to port forward and verified it with  Also made sure LibreTorrent does not have battery or background restrictions.

Torrent has leechers but my client won't seed,"Phones are consumer devices that prohibit you administrator access. There's very little you can do to understand what's going wrong. On the surface it looks fine.

Does LibreTorrent have a persistent notification? It's required to not have the app be killed. Does Wifi turn off after screen inactivity? Overall system battery optimizations? Is Mullvad also allowed to run by battery settings?"
Can my actual IP be seen when port forwarding?,"Hi, im using Mullvad Vpn in combination with qbittorrent,
however in order to seed more effectively I want to set up port forwarding via mullvad.
Will this leak my actual IP address?

Can my actual IP be seen when port forwarding?,"No, Mullvad will give you a port for fowarding and that’s it. Just bind Mullvad to qbit and you’re good to go"
Can my actual IP be seen when port forwarding?,"No, it wouldn't be much of a VPN if it did. 

​Bind qBittorrent to your VPN. This stops all torrent traffic if your VPN drops it's connection or you forgot to connect. It's more reliable than a Kill Switch. 

In qBittorrent, go to Settings > Advanced > Network interface and select your VPN interface.

If you don't know which is your VPN, disconnect it and see which interface disappears."

Would you recommend Private Internet Access VPN?,"Been on PIA for many years. If i were starting today would probably go mullvad.

PIA isn’t bad but they aren’t great either. Port forwarding changes every x times you reset. So you have to keep checking (this is in qbit and different from router forwarding). Split tunnel is also shown to be unreliable. 

But they do updates often, are plenty fast on most servers, seem to be good on privacy and have apps on everything."

Optimal Seeding: Fuck Leechers.,"As somebody who seeds their torrents  to a 3:1 ratio minimum, I noticed that most peers leeching from me use Nord, Surfshark or ExpressVPN.

These companies do not offer port forwarding, and as far as I can tell, even actively throttle upload speeds on torrents. Essentially, every single  torrent downloaded using the services of these companies is a hit-and-run.

This impacts the overall health of the torrent itself. With too many people leeching and not enough seeding, torrents will eventually just die out.

This  prompted me to first block leechers using Nord, Surfshark or ExpressVPN on a case-by-case basis using ipfilter.dat (built-in in tool  to block torrent peers).

[u/daiqo]( (I tip my hat to you Sir) took it a step further by creating an IPFilter list for lots of IPs of these companies. It's not perfect and there are a few holes - but all in all, if you seed and deploy this list on your setups, you should be seeing **less wasted bandwidth being used to upload to these peers who never intend to give back what they take.**

**Introducing the FuckLeechers IPFilter list version 1.0 available at** [**

This will hardly impact the existing level of service for the users of these companies, I am aware, but at some level, it gives me immense satisfaction to know that I didn't waste my bandwidth uploading to them.

To [r/surfshark]( and [r/express\_vpn]( Fuck you. :)"
Optimal Seeding: Fuck Leechers.,"I don't actually give a flying fuck if someone is a leecher or a seeder on my torrent. I've seeded torrents for 5+ years and not going to stop any time soon, i've kept alive torrents that see under 100mb of upload a month, and i will keep going. Leechers and seeders give me the same joy when they download a torrent i've made years ago and they find use for it."
Optimal Seeding: Fuck Leechers.,I think it's torrent tracker's duty to care about such stuff and create such rules and system that torrents will be seeded enough. So all this ip filtering just a waste of time. Maybe it's better for you to find a decent tracker.
Optimal Seeding: Fuck Leechers.,[deleted]
Optimal Seeding: Fuck Leechers.,What's so special about port forwarding when it comes to torrenting and seeding? I have mullvad but idk if I have it or not enabled.

 thanks for this"
Optimal Seeding: Fuck Leechers.,3:1? what...i only do 1:1...
Optimal Seeding: Fuck Leechers.,Windscribe do be poggin
Optimal Seeding: Fuck Leechers.,"honestly at that point just join private trackers. They basically do exactly what you want. Everyone is forced to share. You won't reseed older torrents as fast, because more people seed compare to leach and well the overall size of the total ""swarm"" is smaller"

Several VPN Providers support dynamic port forwarding. What exactly is the difference between dynamic and static port forwarding, and when is one better than the other? Does use port forwarding somehow increase the risk of exposing information to the ISP or remote server?"
What is dynamic port forwarding?,"Dynamic port-forwarding is what PIA and ProtonVPN are doing for example, they give you a port when you connect and you need to add it to qB. This port may rotate often. Conversely, Mullvad and most other port forwarding VPNs let you have a static port, so you don't need to keep monitoring if it changed or not (and thus update qB to stay port forwarded).

Obviously, it's better to be static."
What is dynamic port forwarding?,"Unfortunately I couldnt repost to allow comments.

daiqo explained the most used ""dynamic"" way of doing ports. Another is for the VPN provider to have UPnP/NAT-PMP running on their servers. A torrent client would then request their server to give it any random port. Only few VPNs feature the latter approach.

> Does use port forwarding somehow increase the risk of exposing information to the ISP or remote server?

No unless the VPN is logging who is using what port and when."
What is dynamic port forwarding?,Dynamic port forwarding is an ssh tunnel that allows multiple applications to be forwarded through one single port/tunnel. Static port forwarding is a port forward for each application separately.

BTW I live is us"

Any free VPNs that work with torrent?,I know it is asked a lot and free VPNs might sell your IP but I live in a country where piracy and torrenting is legal and government doesn't care. So I don't care about my IP getting leaked either. My problem is that many websites are filtered and I only want to get passed the filtering. So what are some free VPNs that support torrent?

Any free VPNs that work with torrent?,This question is asked just about every other day here.  The answer is always the same ... no.  Get a cheap VPN ...
Any free VPNs that work with torrent?,"As every single day answered 50 times.

NO.

very likely your PC will even get used as Exit point for some p2p based VPN like Hola or others and then other people do bad stuff via your connection.

and almost all free vpn will rat you out and gather your data."
Any free VPNs that work with torrent?,">My problem is that many websites are filtered and I only want to get passed the filtering.

2. Get Mullvad

Any free VPNs that work with torrent?,"Windscribe is the only one that allows p2p downloads but is limited on data and speed. 10GB is the limit I think. ProtonVPN provides unlimited data and better speed than Windscribe but you can't download torrents with it.   
Also if you're using private trackers then you'll need port forwarding which is not present in the free version of VPNs. Public trackers don't require port forwarding.

But as they say, IF THE PRODUCT IS FREE THEN YOU'RE THE PRODUCT. so better buy a VPN instead of using a free one."
Any free VPNs that work with torrent?,OP - Black Friday sale coming next month.  There will be great deals. Save up some cash now and get you a cheap subscription.
Any free VPNs that work with torrent?,"I don’t think there are any free VPNs with no data cap that support a P2P connection.

If you’re only looking to download torrents, you can visit basically any website via Tor and copy the magnet link (to paste in your BitTorrent client of choice) or download the torrent file, which is a few hundred KiBs, most of the time. 

For streaming, you could look into ProtonVPN, I guess, which has no data cap but doesn’t allow any P2P file transfers whatsoever, but it may not be very fast, depending on your connection, of course. You can download torrent files (.torrent files, not the files shared via them) or copy the magnet link using ProtonVPN, which at times is faster than Tor.

However, I’d still recommend using a paid VPN like Mullvad, if you don’t want to be locked in a contract for years, or Surfshark, which is pretty good for the price, just like most VPN services that offer bulk deals."
Any free VPNs that work with torrent?,"Here's a real answer: Privado VPN

You get 10GB free each month, and you can easily create new accounts with a disposable email service

Will they sell your data? Who knows. They have a no log policy, but to be safe I'd just use it for torrenting and nothing else

I used this myself a while back before I got Proton VPN."

Cheapest VPN with Wireguard Configs and Port Forwarding?,Does anyone know which VPN provider is the cheapest (after any regularly available discounts) that offers both Wireguard config files (ie: can be used with the generic cross platform Wireguard client and not just their own custom client like for example PIA) and offers port forwarding (either static or dynamic port forwarding that can be scripted via an API call)?

Mullvad questions,"Is there any provider better than mullvad? They seem almost perfectly ideal. Is there a catch?

I don't want the hassle of dealing with blockchain right this second. Is there a downside to paying with more conventional forms of payment? They don't snitch or keep logs so I'm not really seeing the downside."
Mullvad questions,"If you don't care about streaming, I think Mullvad is by far the best VPN you can get. It's not even close. IVPN, OVPN and AirVPN would come next, then everything else by another long margin. 

So the catch is that - no streaming support. Oh and no virtual locations, so if you're looking for one of those VPNs with IP addresses from every country, Mullvad ain't it."
Mullvad questions,"You can buy Mullvad activation codes on Amazon, and probably other places. They send you a card with a long string to enter into Mullvads web site, Mullvad then has no billing information for you. I have used it, I order from Amazon so often it was easy to just add it to an order - I just wanted to see how it worked."
Mullvad questions,">Is there any provider better than mullvad?

Depends on your use case.  I recommend reading 
 if you haven't already done so.

_Personal Point of View: No there isn't anyone better then Mullvad_

>Is there a catch?

None that I have came across. But as always a test case of one isn't a test.  So wait until others reply.

>I don't want the hassle of dealing with blockchain right this second. Is there a downside to paying with more conventional forms of payment? 

I'll get around to learning about blockchain eventually when its more stable and the sort.  But until then I pay with conventional forms."
Mullvad questions,There is no catch. They are the best. They just don't do streaming. They are is Sweden and are very privacy based and allow any user to be completely anonymous depending on how one pays which ranges from cash to Bitcoin.
Mullvad questions,"Hello, I am a Mullvad customer.

I think they are almost perfect. Many countries you can connect to, advanced features like port forwarding (many VPNs don't support this!), good torrenting speed."

Mozilla VPN vs Mullvad/are there drawbacks to Mozilla VPN?,"So I know that Mozilla uses Mullvad infrastructure and Mullvad seemed like the obvious choice for me when choosing a VPN for mostly torrenting and privacy concerns. Now there is a promo going on with I think 20% off Mozilla VPN for 12 months, which would make it cheaper than Mullvad per month. Should I use that offer if I won't be using the option to pay for Mullvad via cash anyway or are there other drawbacks to Mozilla? Since VPNs themselves are not illegal where I live it would be fine for me as long as no information beyond me simply paying for a VPN/using a VPN with the actual usage information being unobtainable would be available. Thanks in advance!"

"ISP copyright notices while on PIA VPN w/ killswitch, split tunnel and socks5 proxy","I’m still getting copyright notices while torrenting despite running PIA VPN with every setting I could find enabled/configured

- set to auto run on startup
- killswitch enabled
- PIA MACE enabled
- DNS set to PIA 
- split tunnel: uTorrent set to only VPN, all other apps set to use VPN
- multi hop set to SOCKS5 configured with the actual IP for proxy-nl.privateinternetaccess.com:1080 and creds generated from the client control panel which should globally proxy traffic and make it not necessary to bind uTorrent to the VPN

Ran tests with do-I-leak and passed both the VPN and Torrent IP leaks tests 

My question is I’ve been reading content providers embed trackers, metadata tags, malware or something in the video files themselves. Is this true? I haven’t been able to find definitive answers or what to do about it. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated

How to optimize upload speed?,"Hi everyone,

My goal is to optimize my upload speed to boost my ratio.

Which setting(s) in my configuration would you change and why (I'm here to learn) ?

[Upload could be waaay better](

* I'm connected to the internet with fiber optics (DL 940 Mbit/s ; UL 680 Mbit/s)
* I'm using Private Internet Access VPN service (OpenVPN TCP/501 RSA-4096 AES-256-GCM)
* I'm using qBitTorrent v4.4.3.1 Web UI (64-bit) in a docker container in an Unraid Server in bridge mode.
* I've forwarded port TCP 501 toward my Unraid Server.

Everything is set to default except the following settings.

**Connection Tab**Peer connection protocol is set to TCP and uTPPort used for incoming connections is 501UPnP / NAT-PMP is disabled

**Speed Tab**There is no global rate limits neither alternative rate limits (everything is set to 0)Apply rate limit to µTP protocol is checkedApply Apply rate limit to peers on LAN is checked

**Privacy Tab**Enable DHT (decentralized network) to find more peers is checkedEnable Peer Exchange (PeX) to find more peers is checkedEnable Local Peer Discovery to find more peers is checked"
How to optimize upload speed?,"Wireguard, port-forwarding, IPv6, DHT/PeX, fastest closest server. The rest is strategy (not seeding torrents with many seeders and few peers).

PIA as the crappy VPN they are rotates the port so you'll have to monitor it closely, it's key for seeding. They also have many virtual locations so better avoid them as well."
How to optimize upload speed?,"Step 1. Get a VPN that has port forwarding.

Step 2. Get Mullvad.

Step 3. Profit"

Using Web-based Torrent Client + Tor Browser. Is this a good setup? Please share your recommendations.,"Let’s say a person follows the following steps:

1. Open Tor Browser & connect to the Tor network.
2. Go to Piratebay and copy the magnet link.
3. Go to Seedr.cc and download it to your account (created with tempmail & Tor).
4. Direct Download the final files as zip to your local storage.
5. Close Tor and enjoy your movie!

Is this setup as safe as using qBittorent with binding to VPN?

Since the torrenting happens on their server and not on my machine, even if a particular torrent is being tracked, the IP address that will be visible will be of the web torrent client’s server instead of my computer’s, even if my VPN has a leak.

Please correct me if I’m wrong.

Does the location matter using VPN for torrenting,"no-one can answer for you. but here's some rules of thumb: servers that are geographically closer to you *tend*  to be faster. a server from a country with lax laws is gonna be safer.

bonus tip: if you can decide which protocol to use, go for udp or wireguard, for that extra speed boost.

so, you have to decide what's more important to you, or which country's servers represents the best compromise."
Does the location matter using VPN for torrenting,"No

Best practice by experienced people is to connect to the vpn server closest to you, to minimize latency.  Connecting to a vpn server in a different country just slows things down.

As long as your vpn connection is good, no leaks, you'll be fine.  Make sure you understand what you are doing.  Plenty of howto's out there.  Your vpn provider probably has them too."

Once your vpn/torrent client are setup, go to [ipleak.net]( and ensure that it isn't showing your actual address to the torrent cloud. I am glad I did this because I discovered that some programs will leak your address (only a concern if you're experimenting with split tunnel).

Received a warning email from Spectrum for torrenting,"In my experience you can get away with it for a long time.  I got tons of those emails before they temporarily shut me off.  I called, denied it, and promised to change my wifi password.  I got caught a bunch more times and shut off twice more.  

At the time I thought I had another option for internet, so I wasn't worried about getting cancelled. You need to make sure you have a good quality alternative internet provider if you're going to keep risking it.

You should get a VPN or a seedbox.  I know it sounds backwards to pay to pirate, but it's worth the piece of mind for me.  I got the PIA 3.3 year subscription that brings the cost down to $2 a month.  Spectrum throttles/deprioritizes bittorrent traffic in my area, so switching to the vpn sped my torrents up massively."

Torrenting on modern version of Android with VPN + Android VPN killswitch?,"Please debunk me if I am wrong...

On modern versions of Android, if you enable ""Always-On VPN"" and ""Block Connections Without VPN"" in the Android settings under Network & Internet->VPN->(VPN Provider) settings, it will block all connections and leakage from the OS level which will prevent all apps from leaking. You may need a VPN provider which does not leak stuff bu doing a DNS leak test, but Android has a solid VPN kill switch feature compared to desktop operating systems which can fail and are not reliable by themselves for torrenting."

"DNS Leaks with NextDNS, pfSense, and Mullvad","I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've got a pfSense router, with a dedicated Mullvad tunnel. The connection is up, and it works a treat.

Here's the rub: I use NextDNS with Unbound, and no matter what I do, it seems as if the DNS leak test at  states that I have a leak. I suspect that this is because my DNS is showing up coming from NextDNS and not Mullvad. 

To prevent any non-dns leaks, I have a kill switch set up for my VPN VLAN, and have confirmed that it works without fail. However, my DNS Leak test still fails on Mullvad.

Fallback DNS for when OpenVpn goes down?,"I'm running a vpn on my TrueNas box, which is a FreeBsd OS and a bit.. quirky sometimes. Upon reboot or sometimes randomly it seems, the DNS resets to the router's, which in turn uses my ISP's.

I did bind qbitorrent to the tun0 interface, so nothing real bad ought to happen, but still, I'm wondering:

Are there recommended DNS servers that would work ""okay"" for VPN/Torrent use and also regular internet? I would like to make those default in my router as an extra level of defense as I've already gotten a nastigram from my ISP. Something like Cloudflare perhaps (1.1.1.1) or Google (8.8.8.8)?"
Fallback DNS for when OpenVpn goes down?,"It really isn't going to matter which DNS server you use. Your ISPs server functions exactly the same as Google or the rest - look up ""recursive DNS server"". 

What WOULD be good is if your router supports ""secure"" DNS or ""encrypted"" DNS - DNS over HTTPS (DOH) or DNS over TLS (DOT).    Using one of those protocols will prevent your ISP from being able to see your DNS queries even without a VPN connection."

does changing VPN Country whilst downloading a torrent do anything?,"i made the mistake on my vpn when i had clicked a different country by accident while it was downloading. i’m kinda worried that my ISP will notice that change and i’ll get caught. this is my first time torrenting aswell.

do i just delete and restart over or let it finish downloading??"
does changing VPN Country whilst downloading a torrent do anything?,"First, your ISP doesn't care. They don't look for torrenting. It is the owners of the copyrighted material that care. Everybody in a torrent swarm can see everyone else's IP Address, it's basic to how peer-to-peer works. So Disney or whoever record IP Addresses and send nastygrams to the owners. If the owner is your ISP, they know who their IP Addresses are, and forward the nastygram to you.  A no-log VPN doesn't know who used which IP Address when, so they can't forward the nastygram, and they are protected against what their users do by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - the same law protects web sites and ISPs from the consequences of what their users do. 

ISPs have no legal standing to enforce someone else's copyright. They DO have the right to suspend or terminate your service if you violate their ""Terns of Service"". 

You IP Address only has to appear in the swarm for a short time (seconds) to be captured by the copyright trolls. There is a very good chance that you WILL leak your real IP Address as the VPN disconnects from one server and connects to a new server, which is what changing VPN country would do. 

To be safe, when you switch VPN servers you should pause your torrent client.

Deleting a partial or complete torrent download does not undo your IP Address having appeared in the swarm in the past. You DO need to make sure you don't seed when the VPN is off, either by binding your client to the VPN, or moving the files from the torrent directory, or completely shutting down the torrent client. 

You MUST run a torrent client that allows ""binding"" your torrent client to the VPN - this will prevent the torrent client from using the Internet when the VPN is off. Instructions on how to bind your client are in a pinned post at the top of the sub."

All VPN apps are a perfect example of walled gardens. They all simply boast about speed, locations and security etc.However, none of them is perfect. I feel its a boring experience to use a VPN app + the time spent on such app is quite low.

Is there any provider that has implemented social features to make VPNs more interesting? For example sharing VPN connection via hotspot or any other creative use case.

Really interested in knowing what could be a possible list of social features that can actually be implemented and what is currently available."

What social features can be implemented in VPN apps to make them more useful,"You can't have social media without moderation of some kind, content control of some kind, otherwise people would be posting cat pictures in places meant for VPN discussions. 

I think it is very much the wrong idea to have content control anywhere near a tool that many use specifically for BYPASSING content control. Nope nope nope.

Each individual VPN server needs nothing from the other VPN servers, and all it needs from the backend is user authorization and a way to count active connections.  And a VPN server needs no local storage other than to boot the O/S.

The servers in a social media site all need to constant communicate with each other so that the user on one server can see the same content that users on another server can see.  If you segregate content so one server has one forum, another server has another forum, how do you deal with a user that wants to connect to the Zurich server but the forum they want to participate in is run by the Singapore server?  

And with social media, the storage requirements constantly grow. The need for more storage never ends.  Even if you limit age, the number of forums and users in forums grow, which also increases storage. 


Not a good fit at all. 

And then there is the silliness of putting a service intended to expose you to more and more people on top of a privacy tool. That is just stupid."

Care to correct that?  No one wants bloat crap. Do one job.  Do it right.

>They all simply boast about speed, locations and **security**

If you suspect that mullvad code base is insecure perform a security audit on it.   Otherwise you are just blowin it out of your arse on this point.

>Is there any provider that has implemented social features to make VPNs more interesting? For example sharing VPN connection via hotspot or any other creative use case.

If there is one let it be known so it can be put into a new category to avoid like the plague.

>Really interested in knowing what could be a possible list of social features that can actually be implemented and what is currently available.

Here is a *radical* idea;

* Connect via VPN
* Connect to social network of your choice.

Problem solved."
What social features can be implemented in VPN apps to make them more useful,Mullvad should release some themes for the vpn app like CrystalDiskInfo does. 😂👍

"Good VPN that makes even fake IP untrackable to run multiple accounts, and that has good privacy rating? Looking for a VPN that makes you unbannable."," Say your VPN is not on, so your regular IP is registering, and you have an account on some forum like reddit or whatever that gets banned. Say now you turn on your VPN, and make a new account, and because your VPN is on, there's no way for them to know it's the same person because the IP is different with the VPN on. Let's call it your ""VPN fake IP address."" But what happens if now your new account gets banned too, with your VPN fake IP address attached to it? If you make a third account with the same VPN, will your fake VPN IP address be the same, so they can see it's the same person as the second account? Or will the VPN let you get a new fake IP address whenever you want, so that each new account you make can also have a different IP attached to it?

That's what Im looking for. I am looking for a VPN that will let me never get IP banned anywhere, or give any clue that multiple accounts are the same person. It would be a bonus to be able to operate multiple accounts at the same time, before one gets banned, with separate IPs.

I also see lots of corpo or govt accounts manipulating reddit votes on key corpo and political issues. It would be nice to even the vote playing field so individual opinions like mine can get a fair hearing too. Is there any VPN plus separate application that will allow me to run multiple accounts at once?"
"Good VPN that makes even fake IP untrackable to run multiple accounts, and that has good privacy rating? Looking for a VPN that makes you unbannable.","> so that each new account you make can also have a different IP attached to it?

That generally isn't how it works. IP Addresses can't be used as an ID for many reasons. Most web sites don't care about IP Address until you are really, really bad across multiple accounts at the same time, when your activity makes it clear that multiple accounts are being used together. 

Phones change IP Address when you switch between cellular data and WiFi. Your home router IP Address can change on a whim of the ISP.  If you are using public WiFi for your phone or laptop your IP Address changes for each different WiFi network you use. 

And IP Addresses are not unique to one person, especially IPv4.  Everyone in your house is seen with the same IP Address. Everyone at each Starbuck's or McDonalds generally is seen with the same IP Address. Corporate networks, schools, airport waiting rooms all share a very few IP Addresses concurrently among many people. And then there are ISPs, especially cellular, that use CGNAT and might have HUNDREDS of people concurrently sharing the same IP Address - and the web sites can't tell them apart just by their IP Address. And of course VPNs also concurrently share IP Addresses among multiple people. 

Reddit, for example, doesn't give a darn - I am using the same account right now from two different device - from cellular data in the USA, and also from a PC running a VPN with a Luxembourg IP Address.  Reddit only bans IP Addresses after you have been very, very bad from multiple accounts interacting together at one time from the same IP Address and other means of banning have failed."
"Good VPN that makes even fake IP untrackable to run multiple accounts, and that has good privacy rating? Looking for a VPN that makes you unbannable.","No matter what VPN you have, you can be banned or forced to change passwords if the site(s) you go to, don't work with/allow VPNs."

But there are companies like Strike 3 Holdings that try to take as many torrenters as possible to court and/or have they pay big fines. So much so there are lawyers who specialize in dealing with Strike 3. 

All you can do is wait and see. Might be nothing ever happens - with a lot of older stuff the copyright owners just don't bother.

qBitMF: Use qBittorrent over multiple VPN connections at once in Docker!,"&#x200B;

[qBittorrent running over THREE Mullvad connections!](

I've built a tool some people might be interested in called qBitMF (qBittorrent-MultiFace): [

It's a modified version of qBittorrent that balances torrent connections over multiple VPN servers, which means if you have a fast internet connection, this stops you from being limited by the speed of one (potentially overloaded) VPN server. And because qBitMF uses qBittorrent and WireGuard, both of which are very efficient, you should be able to max out even the fastest internet connections with this!

\---

*(overly nerdy stuff follows)*

This started out as an experiment to see if it was possible to get *any* torrent client to run over multiple VPN connections at once. After much research and exploration, I discovered two features in Linux that enabled this: network namespaces, and multipath routing.

Network namespaces completely isolate qBittorrent from the internet, and thus no kill switch is required: it has no access to any ""real"" interfaces, including DNS or even the ability to figure out a local IP address. It only has access to WireGuard network interfaces and that's it.

Multipath routing balances outgoing connections between multiple interfaces, and chooses the interface based on the IPs and ports of a given connection via hashing, which both balances usage of interfaces, but also makes sure the packets of any specific connection always goes through the same interface.

Incoming connections was another issue to overcome. Since a listening port only exists on one interface, the multipath routing would often try to respond on a different interface, which would break connections. I found that by using a specific network setting in libtorrent (SO\_BINDTODEVICE), I could make incoming connections ignore the hashing that multipath routing uses. That way, if an incoming connection comes in on one interface, it *stays* on that interface.

Finally, I put it all in docker because that's the easiest way to distribute a fully-functioning system. Of course, due to all the OS-specific functionality being used, this will only work on Linux. I wouldn't even know where to begin building something like this for Windows.

\---

Anyways, hope people find this tool to be useful!"

qBitMF: Use qBittorrent over multiple VPN connections at once in Docker!,"Really cool stuff. I've been experimenting with isolated qbittorrent using docker + netns too very recently. Your setup seems nice, but I was wondering whether it would be feasible to alter it such that you wouldn't have to run the container in privileged mode? For my setup specifically I'm launching the container with --network=none and then creating and moving the wg interface into that container's namespace from the host. To connect to the webui, I'm simply creating a veth interface. This seems safer to me since, as far as I can tell (feel free to correct me), without --privileged the container would not be able to break itself out of its namespace.
 And the veth interfaces don't get any traffic routed through them apart from the webui access (no special routes and no firewall entries for nat so packets shouldn't be able to escape the container through veth).

Another idea for portability reasons would be to have the privileged container launch another one that is not privileged if that's possible.

Edit: I've noticed that you were running start-unpriv as abc. I guess that alleviates the problem for the most part, but still. Also I think I prefer your solution with socat over mine with a veth interface next to wg."

qBitMF: Use qBittorrent over multiple VPN connections at once in Docker!,"Whoa this seems like really good work and could probably have ever wider implications for use!

I have a few questions though:

1) would this work inside a Linux VM?

2) is there even any benefit to running torrents inside a VM?

3) will this work with other VPN's?"
qBitMF: Use qBittorrent over multiple VPN connections at once in Docker!,Do you find it improving seeding speeds also?
qBitMF: Use qBittorrent over multiple VPN connections at once in Docker!,"This is very cool but I would want to know why you chose this way with multipath?

Ideally libtorrent would support binding to and listening on multiple interfaces. Since it appears to generate separate random peer IDs for IPv4 and IPv6, some of the required steps were already done. Then libtorrent would need to treat different interfaces as equal and parallelize network transfers across them.

> Since a listening port only exists on one interface

This is sort of what I meant above. To extend libtorrent to work flawlessly on more than one interface."
qBitMF: Use qBittorrent over multiple VPN connections at once in Docker!,"Cool! Never thought of that.

Regarding incoming traffic and routing, I think this could also be handled using a combination of connection tracking + marking (iptables/netfilter) and policy-based routing. And you could also adjust the multipath route weights to compensate for the fact that the interface over which incoming connections are established is used more because of that. So, maybe a 40/40/20 split makes sense.

Would qBT try to connect to itself over the other IP addresses? 🤔 I guess so. But there's no harm because it cannot offer itself a block that it's interested in. 🤣"
qBitMF: Use qBittorrent over multiple VPN connections at once in Docker!,"been looking for something like this!!

Thanks!"
qBitMF: Use qBittorrent over multiple VPN connections at once in Docker!,I am assuming this will fail if your VPN provider does not offer a method to specify an incoming port (I am not aware of a wireguard way with PIA)?
qBitMF: Use qBittorrent over multiple VPN connections at once in Docker!,"Would it be possible to adapt this container in a way that lets you have a separate container that handles all of this networking stuff a d then another container that connects to that network? Kinda like people already do with VPN containers and torrent client co trainers that can only network through the VPN container.

That would make this modular and even more useful."

However, I have not setup anything in my router. I have seen all the tutorials teach you how to forward a port from your router only. 
Now I am confused, is this port( which is also the listening port on my qBittorrent app) properly forwarded? Will leechers be able to reach my computer now? Need help.
Note: I have binded qBittorrent to mullvad network interface.

Thanks in advance."

[

While the video from u/daiqo was helpful to me as well when I initially set mine up, I still had to complete this additional step to make it all work correctly, and it is not shown in the video (at least the last time I watched it)."
Port Forwarding,"Typically no port forwarding is needed on your router when going through vpn. If all qbit traffic is going through the vpn then so will the traffic on the port you set up in Mullvad.

When it might be needed is for example when you run a vpn client on your router. Check for mullvad + asus merlin guides to see an example."
Port Forwarding,"what? it sounds like you have setup your qbittorrent to connect to your vpn provider, mullvad. 

qbittorrent does not need to interact with your router to access an open port as mullvad is already providing an open port to it as asked.

if qbittorrent says the port is open, then it should be open for qbittorrent only, not for your entire house local network.

good to see that you have binded qbittorrent to mullvad. now you wont have to worry too much about accidentally torrenting on your actual network

*edit: accidentally*"
Port Forwarding,"Hello, port forwarding in your router is not required, because the port is forwarded on the VPN server. 

So you only have to set the port number from the Mullvad site in your torrent client."
Port Forwarding,"> However, I have not setup anything in my router. I have seen all the tutorials teach you how to forward a port from your router only.

1. You dont want to open up your real connection via the router. You only need to do anything on the VPN.
2. These tutorials are wrong and if its coming from a VPN provider (I will not recall them, but your typical mainstream names) without properly explaining the difference - I would disregard them forever. Router port-forwarding has nothing to do on a VPN support page."
"If I configured socks5 proxy on my torrent client, should I need to connect to an VPN as well?",SOCKS usually will not proxy UDP (required for DHT). It's inferior in that regard because the DHT might leak? Using VPN is superior because you can setup port-forwarding too.

qBit + Surfshark issues,"Here’s my setup:

MacOS; Surfshark VPN service; but using Tunnelblick, not the Surfshark client program, to connect; qBittorrent with binding to the Surfshark/Tunnelblick network connection. Cable internet service is from a company that rhymes with infiniti but has a different first letter.

The issue I’m having is that my torrent downloading speed is painfully slow, except for short spurts where it will briefly spike up into the 500+ KiB/s range or higher, before dropping back down to zero or single-digits for a long time. 

The torrents in the list are definitely seeing seeds and peers, but are not getting sustained download speeds. 

Some of my settings:

* Peer connection protocol: TCP and µTP
* √ Use UPnP/NAT-PMP port forwarding from my router
* √ Use different port on each startup
* No connection limits
* No proxy server
* √ Enable DHT
* √ Enable PeX
* (not checked) Enable Local Peer Discovery
* Encryption: Allow
* √ Enable anonymous mode
* No queuing
* No seeding limits

The same speed issues happen across a number of different SurfShark VPN servers that I’ve tried connecting to, although occasionally I’ll get lucky and get sustained downloads. Other times I’ll get nothing, i.e. zero seeds and peers showing up at all in the torrent list.

I am expecting that many of you will just say to drop SurfShark and get Mullvad instead, and if that’s your recommendation, that’s fine — no need to make fun of me for trying SurfShark instead. :) 

BUT ... if there’s something I can try in the meantime with my settings to remedy this, I’d be curious to know what that is. OR if this is due to something my ISP is doing to throttle traffic when it senses there’s torrenting going on, that would be good to know also (and would that happen with Mullvad too?) 

Other devices on my network that aren’t connected to VPN continue to get fine internet speeds while this is going on for my torrent machine.

Thanks for your ideas."
qBit + Surfshark issues,"Use the original surfshark client.

So I did a big oopsie daisy. I torrented a few games from FitGirl without a VPN. I'm already kicking myself in the head for that one, so no need to do that. Obviously, we got an email from Spectrum last night talking about it. I've seen threads talking about emails like this, but none covered specific game publishers and their leniency with copyright.

I grabbed the torrent for Assassins Creed Chronicles, but i don't even remember downloading it. The spectrum email was extremely vague. It was the same for both games, and was basically just a copy and paste of the same thing with different game titles. Both were clearly sent to Spectrum who forwarded them to my parents. They said the same thing about letting the person who did it know that they could have to pay like $30k per game.

The second game I got was Elder Scrolls. This was the other one that was mentioned in the email. It said the exact same thing. I grabbed a few other games, but haven't received anything about them. I deleted everything as soon as I heard and don't plan on redownloading any of it. Do they usually let people go with a warning with this sort of thing, or is this something much more serious? 

Should I worry about this, or is this something that happens to people often that doesnt usually go anywhere? Any sort of help would be greatly appreciated."

I always start VPN first, connect to my preferred server, open the ipleak website to make sure it's not my official IP from my internet provider and I am indeed connected to my VPN, then open the torrent app and start my stuff.

Hey so more questions about starting a new cyber life,first off im sorry for going offline for a bit i had a 7 day ban.  Question #1 can my system be breached from an offline computer all my files are on removable drives and i unplug them immeidetly when I'm done so they don't get anything put into them i don't want. Question#2 can my mac address be tracked offline when i hookup to an HDMI cable to view my documents and other files. Question#3 can they track me down across a national border to another country. Question#4 could they see what files i pull up off an external drive when i'm offline. And Question#5  if i got some guys to cook me up an end to end encryption program to wirelessly communicate but only available off of a thumb drive (might not be possible) what are the chances they government will attempt to decrypt it with their hacker people.

Hey so more questions about starting a new cyber life,"You honestly (and I don't mean this in a mean way), sound overly paranoid to the extreme.  


Use a good VPN. Mullvad is my recommendation. It'll solve/prevent almost every question here. It's very secure and works perfectly. No one can access your info on a usb external if it's unplugged of course not. NOTHING offline or unplugged can be tracked or broken into (unless they physically had it of course). Nothing over HDMI, MAC etc. The government is probably (and very most likely) not watching a thing you do unless you're on a watch list for downloading national security shit or trying to, or up to no good which I hope you aren’t. etc."
Hey so more questions about starting a new cyber life,"1: They cannot be breached. There is (basically) no electricity running though it and no connection to the internet. 
2: I do not believe so. 
3: Not sure what you’re asking, please explain. 
4. Not unless your computer is compromised by a virus, rat, etc…
5: Pretty low, as long as it is 258 bit+ encrypted and uses for. 

I’d recommend looking at TailsOS. Tails runs off of a usb and can be amnesic or store encrypted data.  

Your question is more suited to r/privacy. I’d also suggest taking a look at r/opsec and reading the posts there. 

You should read the [dark net bible]( as well as Jolly Rancher Security Guide (Google Search).

Chances of getting into serious trouble through one instance of torrenting are pretty slim, but make sure to use a well recommended one next time or if you ever torrent again.  Your IP was completely exposed to the swarm you were connected to during your torrent, yes."
"I used a torrent, without a VPN. Am I in any kind of trouble?","I find it often depends on the torrent. Stuff that is more popular, especially if it was just released, tends to be watched more closely. Episodes of airing shows, movies just released to Blu-ray, stuff like that. So, if it was older stuff or stuff that isn't crazy popular, you're probably okay. 

My internet got cut off literally the same day, the last time I accidentally torrented without a VPN and it was only for a split second before I realized my mistake. I just had to call my ISP and tell them it was an accident or a roommate and promise it wouldn't happen again, and they turned my internet back on.

"I used a torrent, without a VPN. Am I in any kind of trouble?","Your IP was definitely leaked. EVERYONE downloading a torrent, not just the uploader, can see your IP. But most people who see it don't care about they are like you and just trying to download.  


 It all depends on what you were torrenting. If you were torrenting something that the copyright holder decided was important to trace, then  they might be on the torrent too and see your IP. Typically the more popular and recent a particular movie/game/tv show is, the more likely they are to be tracked.  


As for your legal risk, likely minimal. They'll contact your internet service provider, who depending on what provider you have might send you a letter or email basically saying ""you were caught torrenting, cut it out"". You definitely don't need to worry about being sued or whatever."

"I used a torrent, without a VPN. Am I in any kind of trouble?",Not at all if you're in a 3rd world country who doesn't give shit about copyright infringement. But you gotta be careful what you're downloading and make sure you didn't downloaded a malware because a VPN won't prevent that.
"I used a torrent, without a VPN. Am I in any kind of trouble?",Yes and no. Not actual law trouble or anything like that. They don't look for people like that. They look for the distributor. You're also could be in trouble with your internet provider. I've pirated several times without a VPN and I got letters from my internet provider. So listen. DONT PIRATED WITHOUT A VPN. It's not worth the risk with getting your internet shut down. I know it's expensive but you need one. Others don't inforce it too much but YOU NEED IT. Mullad VPN is the best on for piracy. Hope this helps.
Will Mullvad work? Will WireGuard work?,"I recently moved to an apartment that provides internet access for all residents via a contract with an ISP and I have been unable to download torrents ever since. They have a router and firewall set up with content filtering. I wish I knew that before signing the lease. I have been using an anonymous SOCKS5 proxy for a few years, instead of a VPN, just for torrents. I tried PureVPN before that, but the split tunneling hardly ever worked right and I need that because my Plex server won't work right over a VPN.

I thought maybe double NAT was the problem, so I tried bypassing my personal router. That didn't help. I found out about the content filtering when it blocked my attempt to go to my favorite torrent search site. I think it's complete bullshit that they're doing that, but I don't think there's anything I can do to force them to stop. If I wasn't forced to pay for it, I would just get my own internet service. I can't set up port forwarding because I don't have admin access to the router, so I think a VPN is my only option. I can set up VPN passthrough in my router and I'll run qBittorrent on a different computer than my Plex Media Server.

What I need to know is whether or not a VPN will get blocked by the property management company's firewall. I doubt they would block VPN tunneling altogether, because of people working from home, but maybe it would block WireGuard. I don't want to pay for a VPN if it won't work. If I can't use WireGuard, should I still get Mullvad or is there a better option?

Update: I was able to get torrents working with a VPN, although not as well as I would like. Apparently, the firewall is blocking WireGuard, so I have to use OpenVPN on port 443. When I tried using WireGuard, it would only stay connected for a few minutes. I didn't get Mullvad because I was able to upgrade my proxy account to a VPN account and just pay a little over $6 for the year. When it expires, I'll probably switch to Mullvad."

Will Mullvad work? Will WireGuard work?,"If they have a router, you shouldn't need your own personal router too. I lived in an apartment building in Vegas which provided crappy low speed wifi. All I had to do was log on. I used a VPN more for stability, privacy and safety on an open network like that.

I use QBittorrent along with a VPN on my pc. The target directory for the downloaded files is a mapped folder that is on another PC on my LAN (which I only use as a media file server). Do I also need a VPN on the server PC?,Nope.  You only need VPN on the machine which would be running the torrent app.

Do I also need a VPN on the server PC?,"No. Only on pc with connectivity to the web/site of interest. It is my understanding that torrent traffic isn’t illegal. It can be shaped/slowed down. By after vpn connection is used to download torrent file or magnet link, I believe it is safe to disconnect vpn thereafter. If vpn Porto all used is OpenVPN is super slow so I would do this and have done so for years. Long enough ago that μTorrent client in use predates any id the adverts now impose. Since WireGuard if far faster it really doesn’t make any difference in or off."

Personally, use OVPN cuz of the Netflix bit."
Which VPN should I use?,"I just got a simple question, but first I'll explain: I want to play an online game which is illegal/banned in my country due to a gambling law. It's a game designed for minors and there's a loot crate system in it, which is illegal in my country and that's why the game is banned.

Now my question: should I use a VPN which has more speed (if you understand what mean) or a VPN that doesn't log what you do (the kind that's recommended for hacking)?"
Which VPN should I use?,"If all you want it for is playing that game, try Proton VPN's free version. It only lets you connect to servers in one of 3 countries, so if you're far from all of them you're ping might be too slow, but if you're close and get a good ping, you can't beat the price of free. They have a no-logs policy, the company is Swiss, their app is open-source, and they support WireGuard protocol, so it's fast and safe. If you want to use it for torrents, then you need the paid version."
Which VPN should I use?,"Get mullvad its fast and non logging.

i also dont see why a Non logging vpn couldnt be fast ?

Also dont use a proxy"
Which VPN should I use?,"> Now my question: should I use a VPN which has more speed

You can have high speed but high latency (container vessel irl). You can have low bandwidth and low latency (air transfer). You don't care about bandwidth for games, only latency. This means you're looking at a VPN company who run their own dedicated (rented) servers and who have servers close to your country.

> or a VPN that doesn't log what you do (the kind that's recommended for hacking)?

Nothing is recommended for hacking. It is recommended to work for your country's cyber intelligence agency for hacking."
Which VPN should I use?,Neither. For gaming use a proxy.

Mullvad is a good option - the price is always 5 euros per month and does not depend on the period.
If you need a long-term subscription for a year, then keep an eye on the price of Windscribe and Airvpn. There were deals for 30$/30€.

Couple of questions regarding qbittorrent and binding my VPN to it,"Hey everyone,

I just had a couple of questions about qbittorrent. 

1. Why does Malwarebytes keep giving me multiple ""website blocked due to malware"" and ""website blocked due to trojan"" notifications every time I open and use my version of qbittorrent? I'm still able to torrent like normal, but periodically throughout the program being open it will continually give me this popup. Before I had the premium version I never noticed any type of trojan alert on my PC when using qbittorrent. Do I have an illegitimate version of the torrent client or something? I thought it was one of the more trusted torrents out there?
2. When binding my VPN to qbittorrent, how exactly can I tell which network interface is my VPN? When I hover over my network connection on my start bar, it reads as ""Local Area Connection"" when my VPN is connected, and so that's what I have it set to in qbittorrent's settings. However I read a comment somewhere that this is incorrect. There are like 6 or 7 other options available to choose from. Is the ""pseudo loop"" connection the VPN? How can I confirm I have the correct network interface selected?

Would really appreciate any help, I'm a noob to all of this!"

Opinions on SurfShark?,"New to the page, and VPN services.  So ive had SurfShark for almost a year, and i like it so far. Rotating Ip, no data logging. Fairly priced too.  Is this VPN suitable for torrenting? Just curious as im sure theres something im not aware of. Thanks in advanced.

Edit: This is strictly for mobile android also. And what may be the best mobike torrent app?"
Opinions on SurfShark?,"I used to use surfshark.. had issues with deluge not connecting to peers. they were able to connect with surfshark disabled so I switched to mullvad and had no issues since. 

I did try to eliminate other possible issues, tried qbit, utorr as well, but they wouldn't leech with surfshark enabled even though I was using the p2p servers."
Opinions on SurfShark?,"It sucks for mobile. It blocks the content of a website more than it blocks the ads on a website. I took it off my phone and only use it for desktop, but luckily my two year membership is up in like 4 days and I'll be switching at that time."

Opinions on SurfShark?,use mullvad.

Opinions on SurfShark?,I use surfshark with no issues. My only complaint would be that the killswitch feature is sketchy.
Opinions on SurfShark?,"Every update introduces new issues.

4.2.1 now tells. Me every reboot that I have no active sub till I manually reboot it.

They took 6+ months without acknowledging the bug to fix a critical non functional killswitch

Till the out crys on reddit and twitter reached such high amounts that they finally acknowledged it.

Their p2p detection got false detections so they sometimes randomly switch servers to p2p friendly ones which cuts your connection shortly.

Their software seems to be buggy.

Their addon features like clean Web harm more than help they also tried to bring up questionable features like fake news warning which received such a high backlash of the users that they took it away very soon. 

They advertised a cheap avira based av as protection for months without even having real time ability which implies they let people run into false safety. 

And more.

Generally for streaming and simple browsing  fine for anything  where you need something reliant... Specially if you consider its a vpn with long subs I would say no."

I doubt it. If you were you probably wouldn't be downloading porn.

Bind qBittorrent to your VPN. This stops all torrent traffic if your VPN drops it's connection or you forgot to connect. It's more reliable than a Kill Switch. 

In qBittorrent, go to Settings > Advanced > Network interface and select your VPN interface.

If you don't know which is your VPN, disconnect it and see which interface disappears."

You have to forward a port on your VPN (not all support this, but I think PIA does) and then go to the options in qBitTorrent and in the Connection tab set the listening port to whatever port PIA gave you.

If you were my kid I’d end up restricting the heck out of your stuff. not to be a cunt but just because like legally the parent is responsible for your actions because they’re on the hook for that IP.

btw, it's not like I care about that, my country doesn't care about piracy, you can even receive letters but they are very rare and are also extrajudicial so you can just ignore it lol, I just wanted to know if it is possible to happen with cracked softwares"
are you in danger of receiving letters and fines by downloading cracked software via torrent without vpn?,Yes
are you in danger of receiving letters and fines by downloading cracked software via torrent without vpn?,Well anytime you're downloading copy written material you are at risk yes. That being said most Internet providers honestly don't care they just have to send that letter if the copyright holder has requested that they do so. That's how it works in the US. After X amount of infraction letters that you receive. If you receive too many notices in a specific time then the Internet provider is required to act within the law and can throttle your speeds and even refuse service but that is very very rare unless the copyright holder really pursues it but that doesn't usually pertain to little old you or me. They are more going after the servers hosting the files which is very hard to do as well. I've gotten two of those in the course of one year because I forgot to turn my VPN on before I opened my bit torrent client software and forgot there was something in there still seeding. The Xfinity representative that I talked to flat out told me that they don't personally care either way they are just sending the letters in accordance to the law and that unless you are a very repetitive offender and receive multiple letters within a couple months it's really nothing to worry about. And of course mileage will vary depending on your provider and your country.
are you in danger of receiving letters and fines by downloading cracked software via torrent without vpn?,It is completely up to the owner of the copyright whether they bother to deal with pirates for any individual file or country.
are you in danger of receiving letters and fines by downloading cracked software via torrent without vpn?,"Yes, and it's more about the uploading than the downloading."
are you in danger of receiving letters and fines by downloading cracked software via torrent without vpn?,they will block your speed/internet and then when you call in to figure out why your speed is slow or if they blocked you. They tell you….

vpn would help me ?," 

good night guys, i have been playing a game called tibia (mmorpg) for a few years, and last year i assume i used macro, then they deleted my game account, i create another one, play for 1\~2 months and they delete it again and this time I don't use anything illegal, my internet ip is static, it doesn't change unless I call the provider asking to change it, when I use my 4g on my other computer I have no problems and I saw that every 20-25 minutes the 4g ip changes and this is a location far from me ""300-400km"", my doubt is::

they probably took my computer's static ip and then deleted me for no reason?

if i use a vpn, when they analyze me would they see the ip of my vpn or my local network?

ps: I can explain better if you message me in pv, thanks!: )"

"How does port fowarding from VPNS work in regards to ""changing"" IPs? Wouldn't you need to go through setting up the port foward again every time you change locations/servers/etc?","For example, you set up port forwarding on one of the VPN's UK servers/IP since that's what you usually use.  But a few days later that server becomes slow for some reason and you switch to a new faster one, or you want to change your location in the world.  Upon switching servers, wouldn't your old port forwarding rules not apply anymore?"
"How does port fowarding from VPNS work in regards to ""changing"" IPs? Wouldn't you need to go through setting up the port foward again every time you change locations/servers/etc?","That's up to the vpn provider to manage. For example for Mullvad you just select the city and a random port which gets forwarded. For the end user there's no change after the initial setup.

Now if you switch cities then the port might change but nothing to do with ip addresses."
"How does port fowarding from VPNS work in regards to ""changing"" IPs? Wouldn't you need to go through setting up the port foward again every time you change locations/servers/etc?","If you move VPN server the odds of getting the same port forwarded is very small.  So yes, you would need to edit the port forwarded in your router and in your client when you move server.

Use UPnP / NAT-PMP Port Forwarding From My Router WITH VPN???,"Should you disable ""Use UPnP / NAT-PMP Port Forwarding From My Router"" setting in qBittorrent and in other torrent clients when your using a VPN with port forwarding?

Use UPnP / NAT-PMP Port Forwarding From My Router WITH VPN???,"I doesn't affect the connection at all, but other devices can still open ports if needed. If you only have one PC attached which always uses the VPN, you won't need the setting and you could disable it to make sure that no malicious viruses try to use it."
Use UPnP / NAT-PMP Port Forwarding From My Router WITH VPN???,"You should disable the setting. Even if you use a VPN, the client will try to open up the port on your router. If the router supports  UPnP, you will just have a completely unused open port in the Firewall. (Security problem)"
Port forwarding one one port number with multiple devices?,"Could you seed torrents on two or more devices, using the same VPN account and using the same port number for each torrent client on each device? Here is an example...

For example if you have three computers and you have your VPN installed and running on all three computers and your VPN allows you to port forward using port 11111, can you run a torrent client on all three devices at the same time and seed files or are you limited to only using port 11111 on one device at a time?

With the example above I had two questions regarding the example.

1. If your three devices are connected to the same VPN server could you run the torrent client on all three devices and be able to seed?
2. If your three devices are each connected to a different VPN server could you run the torrent client on all three devices and be able to seed?"
Port forwarding one one port number with multiple devices?,"No, NAT works in a linear manner checking rules until it finds a match and then does not process any additional rule. You would need another port forwarded from your VPN provider for each device."

Do you need port forwarding enabled and setup to seed torrents?,"> but the upload speeds and bandwidth is low compared to when I enable port forwarding

Well you replied yourself"
Do you need port forwarding enabled and setup to seed torrents?,port forwarding essentially allows many more people to connect to you and transfer pieces of the files you're seeding. more connections means more opportunities to seed and hence more upload overall. highly recommended for private trackers.
Do you need port forwarding enabled and setup to seed torrents?,you should 
Can you run multiple torrent clients/apps using the same forward port number?,"Lets say you are limited to how many ports your VPN offers for port forwarding, can you run two or more torrent clients or a torrent client and another application and they can share the same port number? Or will one of the clients/applications hog up the port allowing the other apps/clients using the port to not be able to get incoming traffic?"
Can you run multiple torrent clients/apps using the same forward port number?,"No, one port per app....UNLESS only one of them would be running at a given time."
Can you run multiple torrent clients/apps using the same forward port number?,"Technically yes. You only need it for incoming connections. Each port number can be accessed via either TCP or UDP. You could setup one client to use 1234/TCP and another 1234/UDP.

Is there any torrent app safe enough without VPN?,"You gotta understand how torrenting works my man.  Chances are you won’t get in trouble for torrenting in most places. However It’s old school peer-to-peer technology.  Meaning it relies on peers (other connected users) to contribute bandwidth or data instead of all getting data from a central server.  Meaning everyone can see everyone’s ip address. By design this is public so only a vpn/proxy config will help that.

Or if you wanna get a lil more advanced, connect using Tor or i2p

Torrenting or jus p2p software in general would be perfect if there were:

•More ip addresses
 
•More users (the more using it the harder to catch, they can’t stop us all)

•If ip addresses werent so trackable

•If the majority of torrents or other p2p projects didn’t require a tracker,node etc to run"
Is there any torrent app safe enough without VPN?,yes you can avoid using a vpn. get a seecbox   i suggest seedr.cc

Would a VPN improves speed of torrenting?,Currently I have static ip but soon I need to switch to dynamic ip. So  this will decrase number of peers I can connect.

Would a VPN improves speed of torrenting?,"Should be the opposite, when you add a vpn you are adding a additional connection. So if your speeds are low they will be lower"
Would a VPN improves speed of torrenting?,"It'll not improve speed, but it won't decrease by much if you use a VPN with WireGuard and port-forwarding. 

"
Would a VPN improves speed of torrenting?,"No, you are putting an extra step/server between you and the content you are downloading.

PS: a dynamic IP won't make any difference, they don't just constantly keep changing the IP."
Would a VPN improves speed of torrenting?,If you are not already port forwarding and you got a VPN that supports it and you actually set it up correctly then you would actually increase your speeds and connections. But in terms of bandwidth no a VPN will always be slightly slower than just a naked connection.

My ip,"people are saying no, and I'm not a hacker by even a mile, but I'm gonna say maybe for a couple of reasons:

1. your router could have remote login enabled, or it could have a flaw in its software allowing for the execution of code [
2. You might have software that opened ports (port forwarding?), which itself might have flaws [
3. IoT devices on your network often have web interfaces that you can access from outside of your home network, and I've heard these can be compromised [
4. There was a bitcoin mining operation that just scanned the internet for vulnerable refrigerators [

This all being said, it doesn't make you more or less vulnerable to being hacked just by downloading a torrent. If your network is insecure you're eventually gonna get hacked, regardless of who sees your IP address.

Again tho, I'm not a professional or even an amateur, so take what I say with a grain of salt please."

Caution with OVPN (Streaming),"I signed up to OVPN believing they supported some level of streaming support.  


Issues stared with the vpn configuration files I got for wireguard to use on my pfsense. They wouldn't connect using the domain name in the configuration file (it resolved to a non-routable IP).  


I resorted to installing the app on my Nvidia Shield , this connects fine but streaming is most definitely not supported  


Their guide mentions:

    You will need to activate the setting Enable streaming services in the desktop client or directly on your profile page.

However no such setting to enable exists in the profile page.  


Its all well and good being unable to unblock streaming services, its hard, we get it. But misadvertising is just plain unethical and wrong

Binding Mullvad to qBittorrent,So I was testing my VPN binding with Mullvad and qBittorrent and when I disconnect my VPN everything drops to 0 but Download speed is still up for a few seconds. Is that normal?

Binding Mullvad to qBittorrent,"Yes...download speed in qbit is a calculation, not an actual measure of ""in the moment"" speed. The data stopped flowing the second you disconnected, but the calculation has to zero out over a few seconds."

What did I mess up with qBittorent + PIA config?,"I've been getting atrocious download speeds with PIA despite being on a 1.5 GB up/down Internet plan. I switched from OpenVPN to Wireguard in the PIA settings but after a speed test I only went from about 10 Mbps to 150 Mbps. Plus all my torrents are stuck on stalled or downloading metadata. Also, I don't use split tunnel because this is on a dedicated torrenting VM.

I enabled the request port forwarding setting and connected to the VPN server in my own city (which allows forwarding) then copied that port into my qBittorent incoming connections setting. I also changed the enabled protocol to TCP only as that is apparently faster, but changing back to UDP&TCP doesn't improve the situation.

If I switch back to OpenVPN I can get the torrents to start again.

I'll put some screenshots of the setup here: "

need help,Alright so I was downloading a torrent file but I stopped it half way through because I didnt mean to . Now today I wake up and got a copyright notice from my isp. Now my question is did they just take my IP to scare me from going back to the site or is it something more? thanks in advance for the help.
need help,"Well what does the notice say? Usually the first time they send you a notice it is a warning. Sometimes you have to acknowledge the notice or else they shut you out.

I've never gotten a notice before though, because if I were to torrent, I'd be using a VPN and Binding it"

need help,Did you bind VPN?
My ISP was able to see what I was downloading,"I use expressvpn, I checked the log, and I was connected when I downloaded a file.

I just triple checked the connection, and I was connected.

My ISP promptly sent me a notice of Copy Right for the file I was downloading. 

How does this happen? Has this happened to anyone else? 

\*First time for me. I have been with them for 2 years.  

Does client just gets disconnected without user knowledge?"
My ISP was able to see what I was downloading,"You had a leak. If the VPN was working as intended the address and your details are obfuscated and they would not be able to locate your IP from the download. There was likely a short period of time where the VPN disconnected and your download continued. 

Get a better vpn than Express (read the faq for suggestions) and bind the vpn to your downloader (also in the faq). 

Private trackers will also be less likely to have malicious swarms."
My ISP was able to see what I was downloading,">Has this happened to anyone else?

Yes, there are posta like yours *every* day. 

If you're not using qBittorrent get it. 

​Bind qBittorrent to your VPN. This stops all torrent traffic if your VPN drops it's connection or you forgot to connect. It's more reliable than a Kill Switch. 

In qBittorrent, go to Settings > Advanced > Network interface and select your VPN interface.

If you don't know which is your VPN, disconnect it and see which interface disappears."
My ISP was able to see what I was downloading,Bind your vpn to qbitorrent never trust a Killswitch or just connected vpn
My ISP was able to see what I was downloading,"*1 Never have the torrent program start with Windows.

Looking for an Alternative to Mullvad,"Hello Everyone, I am currently a user of the VPN Mullvad. But the problem with mullvad is that it cannot saturate my 1 gigabit connection. It only goes upto 500 mbps and nothing more than that. I'd like to ask if there are any other vpns that are like mullvad but better in speed? Port Forwarding is a must. 
I tried Protonvpn and their Port Forwarding is horrendous. Hide.me has shady pricing tactics and ivpn is too expensive."
Looking for an Alternative to Mullvad,"Did you try Mullvad 10 gbps servers, such as from DataPacket, xtom or 31173?

As for alternative services, I think only OVPN might compare. IVPN too in terms of features and ethics but I wouldn't expect their servers to be better performing, but give it a try.

Keep also in mind the other comments, you may be limited by hardware here."
Looking for an Alternative to Mullvad,"1) I performed these tests via Gigabit ethernet. 
2) The thing is, early this year i purchased surfshark and when i try to speed test via one of its servers i easily get around 700+ mbps download speed. 
So i think although there might be some hardware limitations, it should atleast reach 600+ mbps right?

3) I did try those 10 gbps as well 20 gbps servers but they were all the same for me T_T

4) I don't think there's any throttling since i get around 900+ mbps while downloading without vpns.

Thanks for the reccs though. Ovpn has quite a small infrastructure. Ivpn is extremely expensive. Maybe I'll stick to it and see what happens when i change my hardware. 

Btw any ideas about Hide.me? Although it has some pretty shady pricing tactics as in you'll get 3 different deals if you visit the site through 3 different links. I heard it has the highest speeds and supports port forwarding too?"
Looking for an Alternative to Mullvad,"One of the issues that one of my friends had was they weren't able to reach >500mbit because their router wasn't able to sustain those speeds, then once that was resolved the ISP was throttling the connection >600 Mbit

So a couple of things that you didn't state/outline;

* Have you performed a speedtest to a local VPS provider that does have decent backhaul while using something like OpenSpeedTest?
* Does your ISP provide 1Gbit as a SLA or is it provided\* as a home connection? The \* being conditions apply.
* Are you using OpenVPN or Wireguard? I have seen \~20% faster speeds with Wireguard over OpenVPN

For OpenSpeedTest its pretty cheap to spin up a VPS these days - even over at AWS - setup docker, and from the OpenSpeedTest webby do;

    docker run --restart=unless-stopped --name openspeedtest -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 openspeedtest/latest
    
    Now Visit 

I did that for my friend and found that not only was his ISP throttling the router they had was **very** underpowered to do the job."
Looking for an Alternative to Mullvad,"you use windows ? expect a max somewhere around 600-750 Mbit regardless of which VPN the windows network stack will limit it.

you also need a High end CPU for that."
Looking for an Alternative to Mullvad,I wish they had app-level split tunneling on Mac
Looking for an Alternative to Mullvad,Which protocol you were using ?
Looking for an Alternative to Mullvad,"One thing to keep in mind with speedtest and ""promised"" speeds is that the connection speed can only be promised up to the provider's gateway(border) at which point the traffic is routed over a peer (neighbor) outside of the providers network and outside of their control.

I can tell you from experience (as a previous Charter Employee, Core network Engineer) that their uplinks are generally oversaturated by 200% (as are most ISPs) and their core networks (if they haven't been upgraded in the 10 years since I've worked there are only using 10Gb links between sites)

There is also the overhead of VPN to take into consideration. Depending on the configuration and hardware I have personally seen vpn tunnels cost 25-30% overhead on the connection."

It's a rather tedious process that requires many steps each time you want to switch back and forth between Disney+ USA and Disney+ Asia. I suggest you create another profile just for watching Disney+ Asia on the app."
NordVPN servers are unreliable. Did 3 different Speedtests on 3 different servers !,"Nobody here uses Nord (or at least shouldn't), plus speedtest is a poor measure of torrent performance imho.

FastestVPN incompatible with QBittorrent?,I'm new to this and am trying to torrent with QBT and FastestVPN. I set up QBT to only use the VPN but it's saying there's no direct connections. I've seen people mentioning port forwarding but I don't see that as an option with the VPN. Am I just not able to torrent with FastestVPN?
FastestVPN incompatible with QBittorrent?,"I've torrented with FastestVPN for a while, it works. Make sure you selected the correct interface when binding in the qBittorrent app, make sure the VPN is ON when you bind it, and when you test it. Also, if you are using the official FastestVPN client app, I highly recommend using OpenVPN client instead. Follow [this official guide]( on how to use FastestVPN with OpenVPN on windows, then try again. (OpenVPN client works way better than the official one, especially for torrenting)"

How do you get good download speeds on qBittorrent while on a VPN?,"one trick I've read is to limit your upload speed to about 80% of the max, that way it doesn't saturate the connection for seeding and instead focuses on downloads

VPN torrenting on Windows,"Hi, I have been torrenting with surfshark VPN on my windows system, with surfshark I use the bypasser so only qbittorrent uses the vpn connction. Everything is working fine, except some sites like primevideo (doesn't load unless VPN disconnected) and steam games connect to the vpn location which is not supposed to happen with the bypasser. And there are some connction drops that take place randomly which is fixed when I disconnect and reconnect the VPN.

I leave my PC on most of the time so want a reliable connection with VPN for torrent and have non VPN connection for everything else. What is the best solution for this?"
VPN torrenting on Windows,"You'll want a VPN that has split tunnel then. Bind your torrent application to the network adapter from whichever VPN(should be mullvad), and then route any other traffic you want through the tunnel."
VPN torrenting on Windows,"If you want a relatively cheap solution that ensures your security/privacy and gets around this issue altogether, buy a Raspberry Pi or similar low cost compute option, tunnel all traffic through VPN on that device, and set up qbittorrent on there.  You can use the web interface for qbittorrent from your PC over your local network and have it set up to move completed downloads to a Samba share/other network storage accessible from your primary computer."

What can people do with my IP address if I am not downloading copyrighted material?,"I'm currently using Mullvad while downloading torrents, but I was wondering what could people do with my IP address if I weren't using Mullvad (or any other VPN). Let's assume all I download and seed are Linux distros."
What can people do with my IP address if I am not downloading copyrighted material?,"Media companies scour the torrent swarms for IP addresses. If they trace one back to you, they send a warning to your ISP who will in turn send you notices. If you don't stop, they can shut off your service for a little bit or forever. Fines have been known to happen too."
What can people do with my IP address if I am not downloading copyrighted material?,"This is a pretty open ended question.  

The short answer is anything that requires your IP address.  Off the top of my head, specific to torrenting, I know a lot of clients by default enable UPnP.  I suppose if your router is setup for UPnP as well, another user could start sending SOAP requests to you and map UPnP enabled devices behind your router.  Or maybe try to spoof DNS query responses when you resolve tracker hostnames. Can they physically locate you? Maybe. WHOIS records would exist for your IP block which may point to your city. Sometimes with cell carriers like T-Mobile or Verizon they use CG-NAT though so you exit their network in other states.  

The scope of the question needs narrowed really."
What can people do with my IP address if I am not downloading copyrighted material?, Not much…if anything. It’s really not anything to worry about. I mean realistically they can’t really break into your machine or track your every movement or get into your banking and things like that. A simple IP address isn’t going to let them get that far and chances are most people are going to spend the time to go after some individual. They’re going to spend their time trying to bust into a companies server or something worth more if that makes sense.
What can people do with my IP address if I am not downloading copyrighted material?,"It depends.

If only you are assigned the IP, theoretically someone very angry could flood your connection with junk data (DDoS) so you can't use your connections.

In the olden days, and it probably still applies to a fair amount of people, the unique IP was not only tied to a household in the US but also had the real person's information attached to it.

Currently (99% of the planet) households use dynamic IPs. The only way to find out something about you is to go through the courts and request info from your ISP. I.e. any sufficiently blatant and invested troll can still get to your information. Not the police or government, if they are after you then they have other clean legal methods."
"I've been DMCA twice now, even after taking extra steps to make sure I'm torrenting through PIA connection"," 

I am at a loss here. I have my client (qbittorrent) set up so that it can only connect through PIA (split tunnel). I have Killswitch on, I checked that my client was going through PIA (check my torrent IP) before I started the download.

I even made sure to delete the games I downloaded (Nintendo switch games) from the torrent client before I closed it. I still got a DMCA notice from my ISP with the dates, times, and names of the games I downloaded."

"I've been DMCA twice now, even after taking extra steps to make sure I'm torrenting through PIA connection","The obvious would be to make sure you bind your torrent client to your VPN. Qbittorent > settings> advanced.

If you're using split tunneling the only safe way would be to have VPN enabled for EVERYTHING then disable VPN for selected apps. Like your games, printer etc. Some people like to only route VPN through your VPN app and leave everything else unprotected. This leaves you extremely vulnerable. If your VPN client has an update and the install location to the .exe file changes then it will leave you vulnerable and your torrent traffic won't go through your VPN. If you accidently turn off split tunneling while you're torrenting it also will leave you vulnerable."

To maintain the anonymity of the VPN,"VPNs don’t create anonymity, they create confidentiality.

Strike 3 Holdings Lawsuit," 

Received the letter today. Spent 2-3 hours researching the subject. Left with a few questions. Any help would be appreciated.

* I use VPN to download stuff, but sometimes I either forget or it disconnects. I am sure I messed up at some point and downloaded with the VPN off. The thing is that the listed IP is not the actual IP I see on my ISP site. I guess those change occasionally? Never actually looked into it before so not sure how that works. The fact that that random IP was linked to me makes me believe that yes, this was my real IP at some point and not the VPN one.
* Anyone has experience dealing with it? How did it end up working out?
* If I dispute, does my personal information go public? I know if you settle it does not, but didn't see much information about it in case you decide to ""fight"" it.
* Does it matter what State I am in? If it does not, any recommended firms? If it does matter, I live in California.
* The date they listed in the lawsuit was 2 months ago and I don't see any emails from my ISP about illegal downloading. Is that common to be the case?"
Strike 3 Holdings Lawsuit,"I’ve heard people get multiple strikes.. and never saw a lawsuit. The most they do is turn off your ISP Account and can ban you - would suck if that service was the monopoly in your town.

Bind your Torrent App to VPN in a Killswitch. This would automatically turn the App off if your VPN randomly disconnects.

An IP address can stay on your Router for months.. or month. I’m not sure how it would work if you’re on a Double NAT (Some ISPs gives the same IPv4 address for 2 homes); and you received a letter about copyright infringement. Would your neighbor get it too? What if you didn’t do anything wrong, but your neighbor did?"

How good is ivpn?,buy 1 month ( i think it was only 2 dollars) and test it first.  for my experience it was awful i couldn't connect to most servers and the ones i could connect was very slow but clearly many other people had totally different experience . Its just nature of the vpn services
How good is ivpn?,"It is a decent service but I personally never continued with them because my expectation that for the prices they were asking of IVPN Pro the service would be better but from my experience they were on par or worse than most other vpns I use.

Copyright notice on Mullvad server...how?,"I've never gotten a notice from my ISP in my many years of torrenting. I recently moved from an apartment with Xfinity to one with AT&T fiber. The new apartment came with a router already setup and managed by AT&T. I've been able to change the settings I need, so I haven't bothered replacing it with my OpenWRT router. All I did was separate the bands and forward two ports not related to torrenting.

Two days after setting up my server again (didn't change any configuration, it's just a Pi 4 plugged in via Ethernet to the router), I received a copyright infringement notice from AT&T with the IPv4 they assigned me, a filename that I was seeding on a public tracker, and the port that I'm forwarding on Mullvad (how did they get this??).

Here are the relevant parts of my Docker Compose file (Jackett is also on the `vpn` network):

Some other notes:

- After I got the notice, I stopped seeding and tried running a leak test with  IPv4/IPv6 TCP/UDP and DNS all showed Mullvad IPs.
- My new internet seems to go out occasionally - could this cause a momentary leak?
- As mentioned above, I'm using the forwarded port feature on Mullvad with the Wireguard key in the above configuration. I set this port as the listening port in qBittorrent. On the Wireguard IP, when qBittorrent is running, an external test shows the port is open. On my ISP IP, the port is NOT open (so how did they identify this port in the notice?).
- My home network (outside of Docker) is on 192.168.1.0/24.

I feel like I'm missing something... any thoughts?"
Copyright notice on Mullvad server...how?,"Bind qbit to the VPN if you haven't. If the VPN disconnects at any point, then your traffic can leak unless it's bound to the adapter."
Copyright notice on Mullvad server...how?,"Thanks all, I just bound qBittorrent to `wg0`. I didn't realize the way the `service:vpn` network mode works in Docker - it just gives it access to its interfaces. I thought the kill switch built into the `PostUp` parameter in the Wireguard config would have saved me, but `iptables` isn't even installed on the qBittorrent container. So the kill switch only applies to traffic directly from the VPN container (which isn't any).

I'm still curious how the ISP knows my listening port when it's port forwarded on my VPN and not my router. My guess is that the P2P client advertises the listening port regardless of whether it is actually open, and that's where they got the port from."
Copyright notice on Mullvad server...how?,"If it wasn't bound, that's why."
Copyright notice on Mullvad server...how?,"You made one of these mistakes, binding or not.

*1 Never have the torrent program start with Windows.

*2 Always have the VPN on before the torrent program

*3 Always turn the torrent program off before the VPN.

Could I get a copyright infringement letter from my ISP for streaming on a fire TV stick in the UK?,"I'm considering streaming movies with free movie software on an Amazon fire TV stick, I'm in England, and on talktalk wifi, could I get a copyright infringement letter?

I looked online and most of the examples of copyright infringement letters being sent out from isps have been from the USA, or some countries in Europe. 

Obviously I'm going to take precautions, using a VPN and stuff regardless but should I worry too much about this happening?

fyi I'm only downloading or streaming movies, not uploading any myself"
Could I get a copyright infringement letter from my ISP for streaming on a fire TV stick in the UK?,"Your ISP isn't monitoring what you download just how much. 

If you use a VPN they can't see what are downloading anyway. 

People get letters from their ISP because copyright holders watch torrent sites and report IP addresses to ISP's who are obligated to forward the letter to their customer (you). 

Again, if you use a VPN correctly your real IP can't be detected anyway."
Could I get a copyright infringement letter from my ISP for streaming on a fire TV stick in the UK?,Firestick for 2 years plus VPN and no issues....in the UK. The only thing I get are stupid letters from TV licensing as I cancelled it 2 years ago....and they ain't turned up yet
Could I get a copyright infringement letter from my ISP for streaming on a fire TV stick in the UK?,"This advice is really for the US only as that’s only where I have my experience. But typically you don’t have to worry about a DMCA unless you’re uploading the content to others. Just downloading a movie itself isn’t illegal it’s seeding it that gets you into trouble.  

And just as an extra disclaimer this isn’t legal advice no matter where you are lol.

*Edited for a typo*"
Could I get a copyright infringement letter from my ISP for streaming on a fire TV stick in the UK?,Depends. VPN? Technically no. But if you’re not using a VPN.. maybe. Some streaming services on the device download via torrent and then you’re allowed to watch it.
Could I get a copyright infringement letter from my ISP for streaming on a fire TV stick in the UK?,"1.. your in the uk so no as ive been using and abusing since the days of lime-wire and before without no problems and many different isp's.                                                                                                                                
2.. Yes as people say a vpn can not hurt to have to give you a bit of extra protection but the problem is vpn's tend to slow your connection down so its getting the right one for streaming say compared to torrenting.                                                                                                                     
3.. vpn choices, well you have paid and free and you need to choose  whats the best for you Example if streaming torrenting then mulvad think its 5$ a month and job done, but for example firefox browser has a free one you can use that will solve your problem and does not throttle for streaming or torrent but you are limited to 5 servers only but you being uk just select Netherlands job done mate."

Keeping other network traffic off VPN,"Is there a way to force all non-torrent traffic to bypass the VPN?

Keeping other network traffic off VPN,"Here is my preferred setup to accomplish that via docker: 

Both qbittorrent and mullvad have existing images on docker hub so it's just a matter of connecting the VPN container to the torrent container. As that interface is the only interface qbittorrent has access to, if it drops no leak can occur."

You don't need one for daily trading, in fact a common person doesn't need one at all. You aren't magically protected if you have a vpn, in fact most vpns are just a way to make it easier to monitor traffic for the governments. They can just ask the vpn provider for logs from a user and they HAVE to give them to them.
Also, Nord is not a king and it never was, I believe it's the worst vpn ever, just because everyone is getting sponsored by them doesn't mean they're good. 
If you want a good vpn to do stuff that governments don't enjoy get Mullvad. That's the end of it.

"newb here, looking for a VPN, but I'm pretty basic and am wondering what best suits my needs....","Hi all!  I'm a pretty basic user.  Here's what I do in america:

Netflix and streaming
Online gaming
The occasional weird search

Basically I don't do anything illegal, I don't torrent (and probably am not interested in that).  What I do care about is avoiding the creepily targeted ads (my wife searches something and I see the ad for it) the occasional geo block evasion for streaming services (is it too much to ask to watch certain movies?)

I want as few people to see what I search and find.  Whether that's the government, Google, Amazon, my isp, etc.  I'm curious which vpn blocks what and what people can still see my activity no matter what.  My goal beyond anything is to stay under the radar.  But being hidden is even better.

I'm also learning about e2ee for text messages and calls.  Any help and advice is appreciated.   Rn I'm between nord vpn and mullvad.....

"newb here, looking for a VPN, but I'm pretty basic and am wondering what best suits my needs....",If your not gonna torrent just head over to r/VPN
"newb here, looking for a VPN, but I'm pretty basic and am wondering what best suits my needs....",">targeted ads

This might still work even with VPN, the advertisers can link activities regardless of IPs.

>as few people to see what I search and find

VPN only prevent your ISP from seeing it. If you're searching on Google then Google will see what you're searching, if you're then browsing the products on Amazon they'll still see it. The government doesn't care about what you search if they're not illegal.

Mullvad is way more private than Nord (Mullvad doesn't even ask for your email, accepts anonymous payment including mailing cash to them) but evading geoblocking is not Mullvad's priority. /r/VPN doesn't allow provider recommendation in general except in their pinned thread, you might be better off asking on /r/VPNAdvice"

Germany Pircay Rules,"
Hello Guys,
sorry if this got asked many times before. 
i am planning to travel to germany and stay there for few months.
i know in Germany streaming or direct downloading or torrenting can get you ~900 euro fine or something.

i am asking about precautions i should follow if i am going to direct download copyrighted media or stream it FROM MY MOBILE .

and what are good paid VPNS for ANDROID PHONES?

can anyone who lives in germany help me.
thanks in advance"
Germany Pircay Rules,Maybe you know this already but mobile data plans are quite limited in Germany (or very expensive). Expect to pay 30 € for about 20 Gb of traffic per month.
Germany Pircay Rules,"For streaming and direct downloading you won't get a fine in germany. It's technically illegal, but they only really go after torrenting because you're also uploading.  
So if you're fine with no torrenting for the few months you don't really need a VPN, otherwise just get Mullvad."
Germany Pircay Rules,Mullvad. Inexpensive (€5/month). Extreme emphasis on user privacy.
Bind qbittorrent to multiple interfaces,"My VPN (WindScribe) usually connects using IKEv2 but sometimes used UDP or Wireguard.   I have qbittorrent configured for the IKEv2 interface.

e.g.

Ethernet adapter Ethernet x520 10GB:  Don't use  
Ethernet adapter Ethernet (LAN) 1GB : Don't use  
Unknown adapter WindscribeWireguard: OK"

Mullvad VPN and OVPN client in docker - need advice on setup,"Hi,

I'm using [this]( ovpn client in docker container in order to setup a network for my downloading software (transmission currently).

My previous provider had simple ""one file"" configs for open vpn, which worked perfectly with said ovpn client.

I decided to switch to Mullvad and the bundle of configs they provide include regular .conf files, but also mullvad\_ca.crt and update-resolv-conf. I don't understand how it works, but all configs needs to be in /etc/openvpn location, otherwise they don't work.

I don't have access to /etc/openvpn on the container side. Can I merge .conf, mullvad\_ca.crt and update-resolv-conf. somehow into one file to use it as I did before?"

qBittorrent not seeding behing wireguard docker,"Hi everyone,

I have recently set up a raspberry pi as a seedbox using docker containers to retain useablity of the pi for other home-server applications that dont need the vpn.

I'm using the linuxserver wireguard and qbittorrent docker images. I can download just fine but my upload speed stays at 0 B/s even though the torrent I used for testing (a linux distro) has supposedly many leeching peers. 
I'm using Mullvad as my VPN and activated port-forwarding and set the respecitve port as the active session port in qbittorrent. I sadly can't properly check weather the port is reachable since I use a headless version of raspbian and for some version curl is not working with  behind the vpn. I have however check netstat inside the docker the port seems to be open and listening.

Facing issues with setting up qBittorrent to work with Surfshark while using split tunnelling and kill switch,"Hi, I am trying to set up Surfshark and qBittorrent to work together without effecting my whole device's internet connectivity.

**This is what I want to accomplish:**

Use Surfshark with Open VPN protocol(better speed).

Only route qBittorrent from Surfshark or bypass all apps except qBittorrent from Surfshark

Turn on the Kill Switch functionality while I am using the vpn to download/upload torrents to make sure that the connection drops **""only for qBittorrent""** if the vpn disconnects for any reasons.

I'm having this issue:

I have set up Surfshark according to my requirements (Open VPN protocol, Route only qBittorrent via VPN, p2p server location chosen etc.)

To bind Surfshark's OpenVPN to qBittorrent I have done this: Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Network interface -> Ethernet 2

Now everything works as expected till this point which I have verified using [

**Problem comes as soon as I turn on the kill switch from the app. It seems to Kill the internet connection form my whole device even when the vpn is still connected. I have to turn the Kill switch off to regain connection for my device even though all but one of my apps are bypassed from the vpn.**

I tried live chatting with Surfshark to see if they can help but after a long troubleshooting process he just basically told me to use either the split tunnelling(Bypasser) functionality without using the Kill Switch or just enable VPN for my whole device if I want to use Kill switch functionality.

Does anyone know if there is any solution for this problem or it's just not possible with Surfshark ?"
Facing issues with setting up qBittorrent to work with Surfshark while using split tunnelling and kill switch,Don't bother using the killswitch if you've already binded the VPN to qBittorrent.
which one is better quality ? AMZN ?,You do know you have 2 different episodes in your screenshot?
which one is better quality ? AMZN ?,first one
which one is better quality ? AMZN ?,Size matters here. Which website is this?
which one is better quality ? AMZN ?,I’m pretty sure both release groups has no differences to them in quality. Their size is almost the same.
which one is better quality ? AMZN ?,"There are few details here to consider:

First, GLHF is a scene release group unaffiliated with torrents.  Scene releases have certain requirements for quality and labeling, but are first and foremost a race to be the first to release. NTb is affiliated with BTN/HDB and is often regarded as one of the highest quality release groups, and is not concerned with being the fastest.  By itself, this doesn't tell you anything about the files, only about who created it and their motivations.

&#x200B;

Second, RARBG tends to relabel WEB-DL as WEBRip.  If you check the filename, it probably says WEB-DL.  WEB is the way scene releases label WEB-DL.  WEB-DL just means the source is untouched and not re-encoded.  If it's true (big if), then all releases from the same source will have identical quality.  If you see multiple WEB-DL releases with nearly the same size, this is often the case.  The differences will be things like audio streams, subtitles, etc.

&#x200B;

AMZN says the source is Amazon Video.  Scene releases do not typically identify the source, so it's tough to say where any given release came from.  This one in particular is probably sourced from Amazon.

&#x200B;

Quality is usually a combination of encoder (WEB-DL should be encoded by the source, i.e. AMZN), codec (h264/x264 in this case; x265/HEVC tends to have higher quality at lower file sizes), and bitrate.

&#x200B;

In order to find the highest quality, I often look for the best source type (esp. BluRay, followed by WEB-DL), followed by release group, followed by highest bitrate.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Just get the NTb release whenever you can."

bad download speeds,"If you run the client long enough you might find enough peers to connect to despite the issues.

Double NAT is a misappropriated term due to console games that had problems years ago. With a VPN you only have *one* NAT point: the VPN server. By default the VPN doesn't let any connections through on purpose and that's why there's a need for port-forwarding."

Split tunnel vs Port forwarding which is preferred ?,"I currently have split tunneling setup with PureVPN to only route my torrent traffic through the VPN, however it has been always giving me general issues, the split tunneling does not even work well and sometimes all my traffic is routed through the VPN.

I am debating switching to a port forwarding setup as my understanding and readings is that it works much more reliably, however it seems to be less secure as unlike VPN your traffic is not encrypted.

I am also debating switching to something like mullad or nord security as I herd better reviews/comments.

Any suggestions ?"
Split tunnel vs Port forwarding which is preferred ?,"It's r/mullvadvpn and considering it myself.  Unfortunately just paid 2yrs Purevpn.  Had AirVPN prior and was good experience.  
Have experienced same issues with Purevpn.  The Split Tunnel feature just does NOT seem to work to expectations...it's not rock solid performance.  The client is buggy.  Windows 10 it freezes on screen, messes with Taskbar, and disappears from System Tray.

Do have the Port Forwarding feature applied (paid extra).  It does give a better connection experience when Qbit configured correctly. ""Plug"" turns to green quickly in Qbit.

Nord upon last check does NOT offer Port Forwarding.

Another issue with Purevpn is that the Port Forwarding is only available countries outside the USA.  This is not explicitly disclosed on the website.  But you find out quickly once you try to torrent!"
Split tunnel vs Port forwarding which is preferred ?,"If it's going out over a VPN it's encrypted. Your ISP will just know you're using a VPN just not what's coming in and going out on it. Split tunneling you are going to say this part of my connection will use the VPN and this part will not. Port forwarding is your entire connection will be on the VPN and protected but you will have a port that you can allow traffic from outside to connect to a specific app/program. 

If either one works for you that is fine as you're connected through the VPN but you should always use a kill switch and if you're using it for torrents you really want to make sure you bind your VPN iface to that client.

I think you may have been thinking of socks proxy which has no encryption but can shield your real IP address from whoever you're connected to.

Bottom line.... Killswitch ON, MUST Bind torrent client to VPN interface, Use split tunnel and/or port forwarding as you please."
Split tunnel vs Port forwarding which is preferred ?,[deleted]
Split tunnel vs Port forwarding which is preferred ?,"Split tunnel is not the same as port forward, you're comparing apples to oranges.

A split tunnel does not give you a port forward. And a port forward does not give you a split tunnel.

Maybe just decide on what it is you want & go from there."
Split tunnel vs Port forwarding which is preferred ?,"Easiest way is to configure your torrent client to use only the vpn interface, (in qbt the option is under advanced/network interface change it from 'any' to your vpn adaptor ) You do not need killswitch with this setup. then just remove the default gateway from the vpn so all traffic will go out directly and qbt will send all its data down the vpn."
Split tunnel vs Port forwarding which is preferred ?,"You conflate the two.

Port-forwarding enables your client to accept incoming connections through the VPN.

Split-tunneling is a feature that allows connections from the apps on your computer to avoid the VPN/forced to use the VPN.

If you only got the VPN for torrents then you want port-forwarding+split-tunnel only for your client so that other traffic isn't affected by the VPN rerouting."

I have tried many different VPN's for torrenting and all of the previous ones cut my download speed dramatically.

It has been nothing but absolutely clear skies and sailing with OVPN so far. I haven't had a single issue with speed whatsoever. Their PC app is easy to use and setup was a breeze. I don't have any leaks anywhere. Even just browsing the internet didn't cause me to have any slowdowns either, I couldn't tell a difference whether it was on or off.

I have only just installed their mobile app but that seems to be working flawlessly too."

How to Use a VPN when tethering from phone?,"Hi,

moving home and will have to use an unlimited data sim for 3 weeks until I can get my internet line in. I was planning on just using my phone to tether to my laptop. 

&#x200B;

My question is, when I connect to the tethered mobile internet via my laptop, use vpn, bind qbittorrent to the vpn etc. Is it enough that this is all done from the laptop side? Or does the connection coming from the phone need to be through the vpn?  


I \*think\* that in this scenario the phone is essentially a router, so doing everything from the laptop would be the same as just having a regular router and using proper vpn protocols to torrent, instead of installing a vpn on your actual router, which isn't strictly necessary. Is this right? Just wanted to double check."
How to Use a VPN when tethering from phone?,"Actually, unless you root/jailbreak your phone, by default the active VPN in the phone isn't used by the hotspot client (some VPN apps have such a feature, but unless they specifically mention it, assume they don't), so not only setting up the VPN on the laptop is enough, most of the time that's all you can do."
How to Use a VPN when tethering from phone?,I do this. If you are using android using something called PDANet. You will need the USB Cable connected by the way and the developer options enabled.
How to Use a VPN when tethering from phone?,"Yes, the phone will work just as a router. The VPN connection on the phone will not be used by the computer (On iPhone by default on android). As long as you do everything safely on the computer then everything will work fine. If you want to be extra cautious then you can get a travel router, GL.iNet offer them for about $20 and that allows you to plug your phone into it and it will act as a router and can have OpenVPN or WireGuard config files installed onto it, it is good for travel if you have multiple devices or just want to send the traffic through multiple as it is on the router and has a Kill Switch the IP is very unlikely to leak."
Using a VPN,"Recently, my internet provider caught me downloading torrents, since i'm in a smaller town they actually check things I guess. So basically I was wondering if using a VPN would block them from seeing what i'm downloading"
Using a VPN,[deleted]
Using a VPN,I just got a VPN last year but received my first love letter a month ago.  Go figure ...
Using a VPN,"Depends on the country you are in and the provider on how quick or if you will ever get caught but yes a vpn is 100% essential these days even in safe country's, unless your in the uk then depending on your provider you only need the vpn to get the torrent started and can then close it down for your full ISP speed but as i said depends on your country and your provider."
Using a VPN,"Yes, that's literally the purpose. Be sure to bind your torrent client to the VPN adapter."

Using a VPN,"That's the main reason people get VPNs. Don't go for a free one, go for, say, one of the top ten or twelve. They all have different pros and cons. I'm a heavy torrenter and use Mullvad with no complaints or worries about getting infringement notices."

Using a VPN,"My recommendation is to switch to usenet. No one checks for that. It's way faster than torrenting. Since doing that, I've been way happier."
Does adding a torrent to my client while using a VPN effect the torrent download speed when I'm not using a VPN?,"Recently I added a bunch of torrents to my client by both magnet and .torrent file. When I started downloading the torrents without my VPN on they ended up hovering between 120Kib/s and 40Kib/s which doesn't usually happen. I tried turning on the VPN to see if anything would change but nothing happened.

A few minutes ago, I deleted the 12 torrents I was downloading and readded them without my VPN on and now they are downloading between 1Mib/s and 7Mib/s. Is adding a torrent with my VPN on causing this or is this a different issue? I have nearly 400 other torrents this problem is affecting.

Edit: I seem to have fixed it by deleting all my torrents then downgrading -> upgrading."
Does adding a torrent to my client while using a VPN effect the torrent download speed when I'm not using a VPN?,Differences in speeds with/without VPN are often due to (lack of) port-forwarding. Give it a read: 
Does adding a torrent to my client while using a VPN effect the torrent download speed when I'm not using a VPN?,"No, if your client is bound to the VPN then it will ALWAYS use the VPN. When you add torrents to your client does not matter.

If you haven't bound your client then it will use whatever network is preferred at the time. By network I mean either the real connection or VPN."
Can't enable port fowarding on Mullvad,"Title is my issue, I logged into my portal and added a port to my device, in this case it was 58685 for Sydeny. 

However, when i enable the wireguard protocol, select sydney in Mullvad and head to Wireguard settings, there is no port 58685, only ports 51820 and 53, which i have no idea where they came from, I never set them up. 

I'm unable to select the port i set up, any assitance would be appreciated"
Can't enable port fowarding on Mullvad,
Can't enable port fowarding on Mullvad,Choosing between ports 51820 and 53 has nothing to do with your open ports. It doesn't matter over which port you connect. If you added port 58685 as an open port on the website it will be open anyway.

"just installed mullvad on pc, any particular settings to choose? ip6, wireguard over openvpn?","The pc app offers much more control over my phone, firestick or shield.

Any preferred settings I should have? 

Ip6, wireguard or openvpn, always require vpn (when using it)?

I ran some speed test checks on my 200mb down isp
Wireguard is 80-100mb down
Openvpn is 155-170mb down 

With ip6 checked I saw increase of wireguard speed to 120mb down. Openvpn was no difference.

Does wire provide more security at cost of speed, or does it matter?

I have the following other settings on:
Launch app on startup,
Auto-connect,
Block ads,
B trackers,

"just installed mullvad on pc, any particular settings to choose? ip6, wireguard over openvpn?","WireGuard, IPv6 enabled, port-forwarding and bind."
"just installed mullvad on pc, any particular settings to choose? ip6, wireguard over openvpn?","Wireguard and OpenVPN are both secure enough and as of today unbreakable.

You should just choose the protocol that gives you faster speeds. Which protocol that is normally depends on what cpu you use."

"just installed mullvad on pc, any particular settings to choose? ip6, wireguard over openvpn?","> Does wire provide more security at cost of speed, or does it matter?

No, it has privacy issues in its default configuration by requiring a text file on the host to save your internal VPN IP to your real IP.

OpenVPN doesn't need that. In either case a server admin can always find out who's connected by looking at network traffic/network rules.

If OpenVPN is faster for you on PC than use it. Whatever is fastest for you. Computationally, OpenVPN takes more CPU juice."
Good Free VPN for torrents?,"I'm looking for some free VPN so that I can download a 30gb torrent without disruption or problems in my network. I've seen older threads and people mostly said ""don't use free VPNs, here is x paid vpn for only 3 dollars a month"". I thank everyone who wants to help but I'm really asking for a free VPN usable for torrenting so you don't have to advise a paid VPN. Anyway, thanks in advance."
Good Free VPN for torrents?,There isn't one.
Good Free VPN for torrents?,"There's a reason people said what you found. Free VPNs always have a catch, sometimes it's features and sometimes its safety.

Torrent IP leak schedule,"Hi everyone, I was wondering how often you guys check for ip leaks?? The reason I ask is I run binhex-qbittorrentvpn (Webgui) docker container on my unraid server. I use openvpn from PIA. On the container it doesn't offer a kill switch and it doesn't show PIA network interface. From my understanding of the container before connecting to the webgui it must connect to the vpn first. I want to take extra steps of monitoring if a leak occurs if possible.

&#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated."
Torrent IP leak schedule,"If the docker container only has access to the VPN interface, then you eliminate the need for ip leak checks.Here is a kick off point on setup: [

Basically, instead of checking to see if you are actively leaking (which might not be ideal), you create a separate VPN container that you then tie back into you torrenting container.  As only the VPN interface exists to the torrent container, if the VPN fails the torrent container is left without any interface to egress traffic through."

"Need a new VPN provider, Mullvad just deleted my account?","update:

Day 3, and 4 emails later, still no response from mullvad.  I guess they really busy putting out fires.

I did figure out what was wrong last night.  All 3 of the mullvad wireguard servers I was trying to connect to, it turns out they are all down.

I switched to yet another mullvad wireguard vpn server, and now it's up.  That was painful.

Hope they get caught up.  Either they are pulling major overtime hours, or worse, not allowed, and went home.

==================

solved:

It is with sad regret, that I have moved on from Mullvad.  I spent all day yesterday working on mullvad, finally got a credit card accepted to renew the account, paid for one year, but they never activated the account on any of the vpn servers I tried connecting to.  I generated new wg0.conf files for 3 servers, none of which would connect.  I sent multiple emails to mullvad support, never got a response from anyone.

This morning, I did testing again.  Still can't connect.  Still no response from Mullvad.  I just bought a one year from AirVPN, and voila! the connection came right up.  I'm still doing testing with AirVPN, but so far, looks good, and I absolutely LOVE the AirVPN website, extremely professional, and TONS of current status information on all of it's servers.

I sent a refund request to mullvad.  We'll see how long it takes them to respond.

Thanks for reading, and hope you have better luck than I did.

&#x200B;

==========original==============

Well this sucks.  Not the way to start the morning.

I just woke up, saw my Internet was down.  My router connects my home network to VPN.  Checked router, link to ISP is fine, but link to Mullvad was down.

Went to Mullvad site, logged into my account, says expired as of today.  Ok fine, time to buy another month.  Went to renew, my saved credit card is gone.  Clicked to add card, errors out, says try later.

A few minutes later, browser refreshed, and now can't even login.  My account gone?  Clicked to create new account, they have that disabled.

So, my Mullvad account appears to be gone.  This sucks.  Haven't even had my first cup of coffee this morning.  Maybe this is a bad dream.

I guess I need a new vpn provider.  One that is fast, RELIABLE, stays up for weeks at a time.  I'm in Los Angeles, so location shouldn't be a problem.  I'm not too worried about price, as long as their servers are reliable and fast.  I have a 400mb/s download pipe, expect full bandwidth when I need it.

IVPN?  ExpressVPN?  I'd appreciate feedback from happy customers.

Thanks"

I can tell you what my ISP (Comcast US) does, they have an escalating series of warnings that can end with you being dropped as a customer. It starts with emailed warnings, then text warnings, then a voice call warning, then they start cutting your service until you acknowledge the warning, after that they may cut your service for a short time before restoring it. They may even cut service a few times with longer and longer outage periods. If you ignore all of those warnings and they keep getting DMCA requests for you, they will eventually drop you as a customer.

Torrents work like this.

* Joe has a book.
* Karen wants that book, so she downloads that book from Joe.
* Dave wants that book, so he downloads half from Joe and half from Karen, at the same time.
* Sarah wants the book, so she downloads 1/3 from Joe, 1/3 from Karen and 1/3 from Dave, at the same time.
* Michael wants the book, so he downloads 1/4 from Joe, 1/4 from Karen, 1/4 from Dave and 1/4 from Sarah, at the same time.

And so on.

Anyone who already has the book, and is actively giving parts of it out to others, is called a seed. Anyone who is downloading the book but doesn't have it all yet is called a leech. The combination of every person involved with a specific torrent is called its swarm.

This system has a number of benefits.

* Torrents get faster and faster the more popular they are. This is the opposite of things like regular web/FTP servers or old peer-to-peer technologies like LimeWire, where every additional user slows the transfer down.
* The files download faster this way, compared to a one-on-one transfer, because most home internet connections are much faster at downloading than they are at uploading. If you're swapping files with one specific person, you can only ever go as fast as their upload speed, which is usually 5-10% of download speed. If you're downloading from 20 people simultaneously, you avoid this problem.
* It prevents the thing being torrented from disappearing. If only one user has a specific file (as was the case with Napster, LimeWire, FTP servers, etc), then when they go offline or delete their copy, it's gone and you can't access it. With torrents, every seed has to go offline before the files become unavailable, and popular torrents may have 10,000 seeds."

Private Torrent Sites,"Sorry if this is this is the wrong place to post this but I was wondering...

How in the world do you get invited to a private torrenting site? Do you just have to know someone? Can you apply somehow? I'd really like to be a part of one (or some) but just don't see a way.

Any thoughts or help would be appreciated."
Private Torrent Sites,r/trackers is the place to go to learn about getting into private trackers.
Private Torrent Sites,"The ""official"" way is to get invited, usually by building up a good ration on public trackers to ""prove"" you're competent enough to follow basic etiquette. The easy way is to just buy invites. Lots of people will sell invites for anywhere from $5-$100 depending on the rarity of the site. It's usually against the rules but it basically goes unenforced."

qBittorrent with Gluetun VPN proxy,"Does anyone know if there's any security/privacy concerns with running qbit through a Docker Gluetun VPN proxy rather than directly through a VPN?

Just to be clear, the reason I'm doing this is because qbit is on a different machine on the LAN.

SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME WITH PORT FORWARDING,After trying to figure this out for 20+ hours(Literally) I still can't connect to my port. I'm using MullVad VPN and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. It says that I added a port but as soon as I check canyouseeme . org It doesn't work.
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME WITH PORT FORWARDING,
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME WITH PORT FORWARDING,I was having the same problem.  Make sure qbittorent is running when checking the port and do an allow rule in your firewall.  Do not disable firewall
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME WITH PORT FORWARDING,"I believe I had the same problem, and I think this is the video (or something similar) which helped me fix it:  
[YouTube - How to open a port in Windows 10 Firewall](  

I think the only thing I did differently is that I didn't change the ""Edge traversal"" setting.  I still have it on block and I've had zero issues."

I can't work out out either."
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME WITH PORT FORWARDING,If you're using Windows it might be a Windows Firewall issue
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME WITH PORT FORWARDING,"Did you forward the port in your router too or are you using uPnP? If its the latter, then your torrent client needs to be running to request the open port before canyouseeme would work.

Turn the firewall back on, make sure the port is open on the router, turn off uPnP and try again."

Downloaded some part of a movie with my own IP,"Édit : Didn’t find how to write text in the post, first time I’m doing that.

What I wanted to say was that I downloaded some parts of the new JK Rowling movie with my VPN off. Then I restarted it and downloaded the movie with an other IP.

So I would like to know, if some parts of a torrent are downloaded without VPN but just a few percents will I have problem with the authorities ?

Or is it ok if it’s just a few percents and the torrent is downloaded mainly with a VPN ?"
Downloaded some part of a movie with my own IP,Congratulations
Downloaded some part of a movie with my own IP,"The question you are asking is *""Will I get caught?""*. There is no way to know. You tell us next month. 

If you're not using qBittorrent get it. 

​Bind qBittorrent to your VPN. This stops all torrent traffic if your VPN drops it's connection or you forgot to connect. It's more reliable than a Kill Switch. 

In qBittorrent, go to Settings > Advanced > Network interface and select your VPN interface.

If you don't know which is your VPN, disconnect it and see which interface disappears."
Downloaded some part of a movie with my own IP,"I wouldn't worry about it. My bro on Saturday just randomly started going off how he's been streaming movies and doing whatever else on something called ezstreams and other streamers. He says you don't need a vpn if only streaming... idk about that.

 Isp is in my name and I haven't received any notice since 2018 when my other brother downloaded one episodes of some TV show.

I got 2 separate copyright strikes for 2 episodes and I should cut em off the internet since I'm responsible for whatever they're doing in their bedrooms"
Downloaded some part of a movie with my own IP,"generally, you won't know until your isp contacts you if they noticed. In my experience streaming without a vpn isn't an issue and i'm actually fairly sure even downloading isn't the issue, i believe they notice when you torrent copyrighted material because you are sharing/uploading the data.

and you'll probably only get a warning letter if anything at all."
VPN Recommendations for Gigabit Connection??,"So, I see Mullvad seems to be the popular choice, but what are their speeds like?

I have a gigabit home connection, is there any VPN provider that can basically keep up with my speeds here or am I out of luck? Every one I've tried so far just feel super slow and a big noticeable difference when on vs off."
VPN Recommendations for Gigabit Connection??,"Mullvad is best but all VPNs reduce your speed because you're literally re-routing all your traffic through a server far from you. That's just it's nature. I have gigabyte fiber normally 940-970 and with Mullvad, 721 down and 358 up with a 7ms ping. I call that pretty decent."
VPN Recommendations for Gigabit Connection??,"Mullvad provides servers that are plenty fast, easily handle gigabit speeds.

Most people's vpn speed problems have nothing to do with the vpn provider, but with HOW they connect.

Most customers use some cheap store bought router, then try to add a wireguard client to it, then wonder why it only gets about 40-60mbps with wireguard turned on.  Because the cpu in the router is too slow, that's why.

Other people install a vpn client on their pc, which is also running other stuff, then wonder why network throughput slows way down when they turn on vpn.  Because your desktop cpu now has to encrypt/decrypt each and every packet, that's why.

If you want gigabit wireguard speed, your best bet is to build a high performance router that handles encrypting vpn traffic for your entire network.  This is the safest option, fastest option, and prevents any leaks too, when properly configured.

The common approach is to buy an inexpensive mini-pc for less than $200 like ([this]( and install router software, usually opnsense, or pfsense, or VyOS, or Untangle, or build a custom linux router, like I do.

With the above $169 fanless mini-pc, you'll get about 400-500mb/s sustained wireguard speed, but it will run hot when buried for long durations.

For about $300, you can get sustained gigabit wireguard speeds with something like ([this]( but again, it will run hot, when sustaining wire speeds for a long time.

I built a custom mini-ITX router ([this]( spent extra to get it the way I liked, with cooling, for about $600, but I can also run things like optional docker packages for diagnostics, management, like ntopng, Suricata ids/ips, prometheus/node-exporter/granfana dashboard monitoring gui, etc.  Mine stays cool no matter what.

I don't know why I bother posting long answers like this anymore.  Somebody always down votes me, I guess because they didn't agree with something, and I'll probably just delete this message.  That's the thanks I get.

Hope this helps, and good luck."

Noob question - why is Nord VPN consider to be so bad?,The advertising they run drives me nuts but what are the down falls of the program itself? Could you compare it to another system?
Noob question - why is Nord VPN consider to be so bad?,"The last time they got an audit was back in 2019, with the complete report only available to their users. Compare to [this sub's favorite]( Mullvad, with the last 2021 audit full result available for everyone to see.

All the money Nord is making from subscription are then spent more on advertising than actually developing their product, incentivizing the affiliates to inflate what VPN can do. In contrast, Mullvad has zero advertising and IVPN even released the DoINeedAVPN tool to dispel the myths about VPNs.

Feature-wise, Nord is inferior. IPv6 for example, Nord simply blocks it entirely, while Mullvad and IVPN support it. IPv6 support means more connectable peers, useful for less popular torrents. Nord also doesn't have port forwarding, available on Mullvad and IVPN, which would've also helped for less popular torrents.

Nord is only cheaper than Mullvad if you take their annual plan, and even then it gets much more expensive by the second year. Why pay more for an inferior product?"
Noob question - why is Nord VPN consider to be so bad?,"I used Nord for three years, I bought the plan and felt I had to get my money's worth.  It ended two months ago and I switched to Mullvad.  The difference in speed is like night and day.  My torrents always ground to a halt on Nord, now I don't even know I'm using a VPN with wireguard.  Can't recommend it too highly."
Noob question - why is Nord VPN consider to be so bad?,"Their marketing gave us problems. They don't pay for it so we were bombarded with affiliate links.

More importantly, [their Warrant Canary status seems problematic, see here]("
Noob question - why is Nord VPN consider to be so bad?,"1. NordVPN doesn't offers port forwarding. Which is essential in torreting, especially in private trackers.

2. Split tunneling no longer works properly since version 6.40."
Noob question - why is Nord VPN consider to be so bad?,Is Wireguard a VPN or an add on to enhance a VPN?
Noob question - why is Nord VPN consider to be so bad?,"I'm a little late, but NordVPN also allows you to setup 2fa without validation for your email, so when my password was leaked (I think unrelated to Nord? I used to have not great password hygiene) they just setup the 2fa and locked me out. I had my email, username, changed my password and still couldn't get in. Took me months of going back and forth with them to get them to cancel my account. It was THE WORST customer experience of my life and *why in the world would you allow 2fa to be setup with no confirmation AT ALL?* Exhausting."
Noob question - why is Nord VPN consider to be so bad?,"Try cancelling nord, you'll find out.  They will keep charging you, until you put an empty pre-paid debit card on your account.  Somebody actually started a class action lawsuit to stop them, but nord is in the Bahama's, which means some lawyer will have to fly down there and sue them in a local court.

Also, their wireguard is proprietary, unlike other vpn providers which make it easy for you to use any open source wireguard implementation.

Other than that, their openvpn is solid and reliable, they are still good for streaming content from other countries, etc."

VPN acting wierd and not actually doing anything,"So I turn on my VPN (I use PIA) and start torrenting and everything is perfect. I can see the torrent is doing 100 Mbps and the VPN is saying the same on its own graph. 

This is where the trouble begins. I come back a couple hours later and the VPN was on and everything was fine but it was showing 50 Mbps on its graph, but the torrent is at 100 Mbps. Now at first I thought this was just a glitch and kept going. Then the next day I get 8 notices from my ip about stuff I downloaded. 

I'm not doing anything to the VPN, I did dns leak tests and shields up port scans and I was good. I don't split tunnel or anything. 

What is going on here?"
VPN acting wierd and not actually doing anything,Did you bind? (pinned thread on the subreddit)

I followed [this guide]( but canyouseeme.org said the connection timed out and qbittorrent is unable to download or upload. I'm confused since the commenter's guide seemed very simple, but I see now that the info may be outdated. Any idea as to what may be causing this?"
Port forwarding not working. Any common fixes?,"I would double check that your torrent client is bound to the correct network interface if you're binding it.  Not being able to download or upload at all sounds like potentially another issue altogether.  Maybe double check your firewall(s) as well.

I don't use the PIA client, but rather the [PIA scripts for OpenVPN/Wireguard]( which you can setup to use servers that support port fowarding.  Once I'm connected, it tells me the port that I've been assigned which I plug into Qbittorrent."
Port forwarding not working. Any common fixes?,PIA pf is reliable but the server needs to support it and you have to check the id periodically to ensure it didn’t change
Port forwarding not working. Any common fixes?,"It's working perfectly here, so it's not a PIA client issue. The port has to be forwarded in your router and open on your firewall. Some people will say I'm wrong, but for me it doesn't work unless these are done."

Is Cryptofree viable?,Title. I know it's basically a meme to ask for a free VPN but reading its page on the Cryptostorm website (a presumably biased source) it seems pretty good. Does anyone have any experiences that might turn me away from using the free service at least?

a) only server in France

b) no port-forwarding

c) not that easy to setup for WireGuard if you're a newbie"
Has anyone thought of this idea on VPN's and implemented it?,"As many of you know a lot of free VPN's have data limits. Most of these data limits reset after a week/month

I wish someone created a program that basically did this

Use task manager to enable Your first VPN to open upon startup

Once the data limit is reached, the ""program"" will close the VPN and automatically opens a different VPN application with another data limit. If a data limit is reached then the old application is closed and down the list you go.

Free VPN's are not exactly trustworthy but some are better than others. So choose the VPN's you think are the the most most trustworthy then implement them into the hypothetical programs directory"
Has anyone thought of this idea on VPN's and implemented it?,Just pay the $5 per month VPN with Mullvad. Don't be that cheap OP. This post is ridiculous.

But since it is depending on networking and protocols, security maintenance and updated will be necessary. Let's budget roughly 10 hours per quarter for that. A good software dev these days makes roughly $100/hr if working full-time the US, probably triple that if contracting, and maybe a bit less if in a poorer country. So in sum, it would cost $7,000 to get the program up and running in the first year, and then another $4,000 per year to keep it going. To say nothing of distribution costs, etc.

Let's say they charge $1/month for using the program. They would need about 10,000 subscribers for it to begin to be worth it. Are there 10,000 cheapskates willing to pay $1 a month to manage free VPNs but not willing to pay $5 for a full-on VPN? I highly doubt it."

Are there any disadvantages of port forwarding?,"You only allow a single port to be forwarded. Your other devices don't even belong to your computer where the VPN connection is running, they cannot be reached.

Port-forwarding improves connectivity. If your speed was limited by amount of peers reachable, now you'll be able to reach more thus higher speeds. If there were 100s of peers, you'll notice no difference because enough of them have functional port-forwarding to compensate for you.

What do I have to do so that there is no chance that a website can identify me from a previous visit? Somehow a specific was able to know it was me despite doing what I thought was enough to prevent that.,"edit: specific SITE**. I should proof read.

I know this is not directly torrent related but this is the most active/knowledgeable sub for this that I've found. Please don't crucify me.

I've had to log into a site for work a lot the last few days and randomly it was making me do captchas quite often. I have a static residential VPN, but my Windows was fucking up because of another program and my VPN was going in and out a ton and I didn't realize, and I think it just made me look sketchy to this website. 

I know my VPN doesn't have ip ranges that could be detected (for residential at l east...i checked), so I felt like just getting a new IP in a new location was good enough. I cleared my cookies, had a new IP, went back...still got a captchas. I tested it on my phone with my mobile data and didn't get one, so i'm 99% sure it's still recognizing me. Strange. 

Despite feeling confident that my VPN was not the issue (it's a nice residential IP VPN that fools every IP test website I go to) I still got a trial for another nice residential IP VPN just to be double safe that there was no weird IP issue. I connected to that new VPN. I got on a different Chrome profile that I've never used for this website, I'm on a totally new VPN, and it still recognizes me. How????????

I didn't clear cookies from the other chrome profile because I was quite sure they're totally separate, but now I have no idea. Can one chrome profile look at the cookies from another? Just doing some reading, I saw that sites can potentially identify other ""user accounts"". I was not sure if this was talking about other sites you're logged into, or other chrome profiles, and it detected the same 3 chrome profiles, so it knew it was me, or something. 

Basically I just wanna know how this could have identified me, and how I can prevent it. What all things can it look at that can be used to identify that you are the same PC that's been to the website in the past. I want to be able to go to websites and them have no clue (assuming i'm on a new IP). 

In the past I've used ghostery and canvas blocker, are these 2 things + clearing cookies enough to obfuscate things? Or are there other things I have to do? 

Thanks!"
What do I have to do so that there is no chance that a website can identify me from a previous visit? Somehow a specific was able to know it was me despite doing what I thought was enough to prevent that.,"Not sure what you mean by the site recognised you?  Can you elaborate.

If it’s just that it’s still showing you captchas, with all the effort to hide from tracking/detection it likely is that you just look like a bot,  not necessarily the same bot it remembers.

There’s also a myriad of other digital fingerprinting that may be involved. (Screen res, supported languages, patch level, plugins installed, etc on top of IP or cookies)"

Choosing VPN with Synology NAS,"I've been reviewing everything I could find related to Synology in here over the past couple months. Mullvad seems like the most recommended VPN around here, and I'm good with that after comparing with others.

I would like my VPN to accommodate both qbitorrent (I'm good with that as I've read how to bind it) and my Synology NAS, and that's where my question comes in.

It seems to me that I can simply enter the VPN information in the DSM control panel. Is that true? I see almost every post about VPNs with Synology including a docker container. Is it recommended that I install Docker on my NAS and then the qbitorrent Docker app? And if so, will that automatically bind to Download Station (for mobile use)."
Choosing VPN with Synology NAS,"Using a qbittorrent docker container with VPN enabled will only tunnel through your VPN provider and will not apply its settings to the DSM control panel.

DSM itself does not support network binding which is the reason why creating a qbittorrent container is strongly recommended. You can still set up a VPN in DSM but keep in mind that if your VPN provider/connection goes down, your actual IP address will leak. I would strongly recommend you stray away download station for torrenting. If you need mobile use, you can setup port forwarding to your docker container."

Port forwarding," I was doing some reading on port forwarding to see if I need to do it for my torrenting and found the following. I'm curious to know what the community thinks.

**Allowing hackers in:** port forwarding can let hackers compromise your security. All they have to do is learn your ports and IP, and they can just breeze past your firewall. 

**Bypassing VPN security:** Now imagine you got a VPN to secure your connection. Your data is encrypted, your ISP is blinded, nobody knows where you’re connecting from. However, if you would decide to forward a port, which is possible with some VPNs, you would just open a path into your systems that will bypass even the additional security layer granted by any VPN software. 

**Creating breaches in privacy:** UPnP poses even more security risks. The fact that the process is automated makes it a lot easier to exploit for hackers and other malicious actors. In January 2019, a [hacker group used vulnerabilities in UPnP routers]( to make Chromecasts, smart TVs, and Google Homes play videos urging to subscribe to PewDiePew on YouTube. 

**Making your devices a hub for hackers:** This case is more annoying than really harmful, but other UPnP exploits allowed hackers to use [exposed devices in botnets]( spam campaigns and distributed-denial-of-service attacks. And that is aside from their ability to install malware, steal your data (like logins and photos) and access your devices (like webcams)."
Port forwarding,"> Allowing hackers in:

There're few select providers that give you a dedicated IP (either optionally or always) and then it is your choice to either enable 1,2,3... ports to be forwarded or open the flood gates. You only need one port dedicated for your client to be open.

> just open a path into your systems that will bypass even the additional security layer granted by any VPN software. 

VPN software doesn't grant ANY additional security. It simply reroutes traffic. Usually (with/without port-forwarding) it will block all incoming connections other than the ones required (chosen port forward + active connections originating from your PC)

> Creating breaches in privacy: UPnP

There're 2 different topics: One, UPnP in routers. That's the awful quality of the devices/firmware you have, nothing to do with UPnP. Second, UPnP that allows local applications to easily request to open ports. This is not needed for 99.9% of malware, instead it connects to Command&Control servers outside to receive commands. UPnP isn't required in most cases and it doesn't work for the majority of residential connections too. There's no incentive to use it for malware.

> Making your devices a hub for hackers:

When using C&C servers all of the above can be done and is done the same way. Only outgoing connections, no incoming.

Nothing you described is relevant to what we're doing here. I'd like to explain more to clear any doubt.

First: UPnP allows software to request the gateway (router, VPN) to forward a port on their end, such that: Unknown internet packet -> gateway -> software on your PC can receive it. That is to **allow incoming connections.**

That's why you can't host a Minecraft server at home, your friends send connection requests to you and these are denied/not forwarded because the gateway doesn't know the packet's intended destination.

1. You can disable UPnP on your router. We use VPNs here anyway. With a disabled UPnP on router, you can still manually open a port in router configuration.
   - both links tell a story of shitty firmware. UPnP shouldn't respond to the internet at all, only inside the LAN
2. By using a bittorrent client that connects to arbitrary peers, you already exchange information with clients you don't know. If someone finds a vulnerability in your client, they can exploit it when you connect to them - port-forwarding doesn't change this fact.
   - on the other hand, if this armageddon type of event happens, mass scanning of IPs will find you and run the exploit without lurking in swarms to wait for your connection
   - lurking in every single swarm out there is also technically possible, in the end this is the same
3. You only open the single port to your Bittorrent client. If it's not running, the packets go to nowhere (dropped). When running it receives them. Following the last point, your *attack surface* has not changed.
4. If the VPN supports UPnP, only apps that request it will receive an open port. Only game servers and similar software do that. Otherwise nothing happens, everything else remains shut.

After my other posts on the matter (see pinned on profile) this is the first question that actually went in depth about closely related security concerns. Good job"
Port forwarding,"It's true that Port forwarding can allow hackers in.

Normally your VPN manages the ports and your security, and if you open one that is a vulnerability. But if you use that open port in a torrent client (I recommend qBittorent), then the client will handle this ports security.

This means that as long as you use a good and trustworthy torrent client, you will stay safe."
Port forwarding,Understand that there are two kinds of port forwarding. Most articles talk about the router kind not the vpn kind.
Port forwarding,"I’ve been port forwarding servers for years without issue. I would use a high external port like 50,000-100,000 and forward that to the internal port you actually want the traffic to go to. This effectively encrypts the port so hackers can’t scan your firewall for open ports"
How to get seeding working withough being blocked,"I've been testing my new transmission+openvpn with NordVPN setup, and the upload speed always stays at 0kb/s when torrenting.

I will switch to a better VPN provider like Mullvad once my nordvpn subcription has run out, but in the meantime, is there anything I can try to get uploads working better? For example, different torrent client, different VPN connection protocol?"

Therefore, if my address is hidden via VPN, copyright trolls can't track me down.

But what if you join like a Telegram group on your phone (so no VPN) where people freely share files? Could some malicious person enter the chat and somehow check who downloaded what, and get you in trouble?

Keepsolid VPN Unlimited throttling,"I've been having poor results torrenting over Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited service, so I set up a test.

I recall back when Keepsolid's VPN service was great for torrenting, their torrent servers seemed permanently overloaded, showing yellow or red in the server list. This made them only really usable for torrenting, since any other activities suffered heavy packet loss. Now that they're borderline unusable for torrenting, they're permanently green in the server list and all other activities are snappy without any packet loss.

Internet provider coming after me for piracy… I always have my VPN on. Not sure how or why they are seeing any activity (I also rarely download anything or host anything),Your torrent agent has a DNS leak. You need to bind your VPN to your client and choose the option to only download when connected to the proxy. You can find instructions on how to set this up in most of the VPN providers website
Internet provider coming after me for piracy… I always have my VPN on. Not sure how or why they are seeing any activity (I also rarely download anything or host anything),Make sure your DNS isn't leaking on ipleak.net and use the torrent magnet link thing they have. If your vpn machine is using ipv6 it will leak on and off.

3. Switch to a better VPN if you can"
Internet provider coming after me for piracy… I always have my VPN on. Not sure how or why they are seeing any activity (I also rarely download anything or host anything),"What do you mean by coming after you? Did you get a warning letter, or?

Edit: just keep in mind that your ISP typically has to do something about it, even if it is only sending a warning letter or few at first. There are (lawyer/copyright?) firms out there, I guess, that monitor the IPs that torrent stuff, then send out letters to the ISPs that own those IPs, or something like that...

I'm not telling you to not take it seriously, but just keep in mind that this is mostly how/why it seems to happen. As others have said here/on your other post, it seems like people can mostly avoid this happening by both using a good VPN AND binding the VPN to the torrent program, so that there shouldn't be leaks. Don't trust kill switches on VPNs, either. 

Honestly though, I don't really ""download Linux ISOs"".... Streaming is cheap enough, and most things are available in some way or another. If you don't wanna worry about it, just do it the right way and pay the creators/content holders for what you want"

Does it make sense to use VPN to hide my public IP from the swarm?,"Hello, I use a vpn to hide my IP address from the people in the swarm, because I'm paranoid that someone can use that IP for malicious intent. The copyright laws aren't as strict in my country, so VPN isn't necessary for concealing it from my ISP. Is it completely unnecessary to do this? I'm cutting down my connection speed by having a VPN on. I don't want to do that without a valid reason.

Also, is it even possible for a hacker to get access to my network with just my public IP address? I've also read that I would be a low priority target, so it would be unlikely for anyone to have me in their crosshairs. So, should I just stop using it or is there a security risk?

Thanks."
Does it make sense to use VPN to hide my public IP from the swarm?,How are you cutting down your connection speed in half?  Im on a vpn and I max out my download at 160MB/sec with wiregaurd
Does it make sense to use VPN to hide my public IP from the swarm?,"> because I'm paranoid that someone can use that IP for malicious intent.

They can't, unless the torrent client itself has a major vulnerability but then you wouldn't be alone.

> The copyright laws aren't as strict in my country, so VPN isn't necessary

*Then it's not necessary for you!* You don't need to think about it again.

> Also, is it even possible for a hacker to get access to my network with just my public IP address?

If that were possible, the entire IPv4 address space can be scanned with some effort. The only way to ""break into"" your network is to have all ports open without a firewall and a vulnerability to enable the breach.

The only reason you could use the VPN for is if you need port-forwarding. You're fine."
Friend is saying that connecting to USA for torrenting isn't safe.,"Basically, my friend is saying that the VPN we use (ExpressVPN) doesn't log your data, but the state can through the websites you visit.

Even if a US VPN is logless, FBI can use a warrantless trace and ask the VPN for help which will build a case under the VPN server your connected too. Usually it takes month or even years. Same goes with other countries in the 14 eyes - they can share data and cooperate with the US courts on information."

Friend is saying that connecting to USA for torrenting isn't safe.,yes they can log your data from the website and even at your own computer plus All VPN Providers Log data and even if they Don't the Companies they use do All VPN Providers use servers from other companies like Google and Google Logs all that Data so unless you make your Own VPN on your Own Servers it's Pointless
Friend is saying that connecting to USA for torrenting isn't safe.,"It depends on what you're doing though your VPN.

If you separate your identifying internet use from your VPN then you'll remain anonymous."
Friend is saying that connecting to USA for torrenting isn't safe.,"Yes, it's possible. But are they going to do it? No. The VPN will likely not help with things like cookies and fingerprinting that sites will take from your system. So it is possible that they CAN trace it back to you. But unless you're running some dark web drug store, no one will put in that effort to find your identity.

What's the best location to set my VPN when torrenting?,"Doesn't make a difference.

If you're using one of the recommended VPNs then they have a no logging policy backed by some sort of evidence (audit/court) and years of operation without hiccups. Thus it's irrelevant which country you're using, choose the nearest one (including own) for best performance.

However, some people feel uneasy about it if you're in a country that is particularly harsh on copyright, or you may want to feel like you're helping the VPN by avoiding using servers in countries that will bring more attention to it and the server providers.

In the end it doesn't really matter that much."

I'm not sure if Mullvad is working on my nvidia shield/Kodi. Both settings still show my home ip connected,"
Hi I just bought a one time month of Mullvad to put on my nvidia shield.

I've went through these steps:

Bought Mullvad and got my key.

Went to my nvidia shield

Used Downloader app to go to mullvad.net

From there, clicked install link which forward to android app. Downloaded and installed on shield.

Inserted my key, and connected to another ip.

While it says connected, the nvidia shield settings shows connected still to my home ip.

Next I opened Kodi which has xenon plus 8.3 build, and it's network settings also show my home ip as connected. Unfortunately before I saw all this I browsed some content thinking mullvad connected was doing anything.

How do I get this vpn to work on my shield/kodi or a firestick? I'm not sure what the app is working, otherwise the shield and kodi would have its connected ip rather than my own.

I can't seem to find any youtube tutorials on installing this vpn to shield/kodi or a firestick 4k max I just bought. But I followed the FAQ install.

Thank you."
I'm not sure if Mullvad is working on my nvidia shield/Kodi. Both settings still show my home ip connected,"Is that your IP address showing, or your localIP?

The local network interface will still have your 192.***.** IP address,
but there will be an additional interface for the VPN tunnel.

If you visit a website (for example our check site
 ) you will see if you're properly
connected/using our VPN.

Seems to be working and vpn checks out. Was just weird that both my shield and kodi network settings didn't reflect this but I guess that's not how it's processed. New to this still"

Received an AUP violation email,"So I finally decided to download *something* with qbittorrent and I immediately got an email from my ISP talking about an AUP violation.

IP location changes to the Netherlands whenever I begin torrenting with Surfshark VPN,"I use Surfshark as my VPN and used to use Transmission to torrent, but have now switched to qbittorrent.

I have an odd error (don't even know if its an error or just a weird occurrence) where my IP location changes to the Netherlands whenever I begin torrenting with my VPN on.

For example here's a normal timeline of the events that happen:

I turn my VPN on and select a specific country server to connect to.
I can browse/stream/whatever for hours and my connection will still appear from the country I selected from the VPN client.
Then I open up my torrent client and begin torrenting.
Within the next 5-10 minutes my network location suddenly changes to the Netherlands.
No matter if I disconnect and reconnect to the VPN, to any different server, my IP address online stays the same and I am still seen as if I am in the Netherlands.
Completely quitting my VPN has no effect, neither does closing my torrent client, or disconnecting and reconnecting to my internet connection.
The only way to fix this issue I have found is to restart my PC.

I first thought this issue was due to transmission, and when I swapped to qbittorrent for the first couple of days it was ok, then it started happening again. I reinstalled Surfshark and had no luck.

Keep paying for ExpressVPN or switch over to Norton’s?,"In all honesty, I wouldn’t go with either…I had ExpressVPN and recently switched to Mullvad VPN (this communities favourite) and to be honest I wouldn’t turn back. It’s £5 per month so cheaper then Express VPN and it’s just as fast if not faster to Torrent, plus it’s far more transparent on its privacy policies. 
So yeah, I’d go with that."

How can I check if my deluge/radarr/sonarr is properly using my proxy?,"This may be relevant to other... uninformed people like myself...

I   set up a home server as automated as possible using plex, sonarr,   radarr, jackett, and deluge. Of course, I forgot to set up a proper vpn   and got an email from my ISP.

So, now I have a vpn and added my VPN proxy info (SOCKSv5 W/ Auth) into both the desktop app and webui for deluge, and added split tunneling/kill switch for the desktop app (to be honest, I'm not entirely sure which is being used for sonarr/radarr).

How do I now check if I'm properly protected? I know there are specific magnet links to do so, but I'm not sure how to load that into the webui (which I think is the domain being used by sonarr and radarr)."

So what I used to do is have a self-hosted one for clean traffic and then use Astrill VPN for torrenting. It yielded much better results than other more advertised VPNs for China like ExpressVPN, but it varies on the city you are and the ISP.

Does seeding with port forwarding help other non port forwarded peers find each other?,For example say I'm seeding on a low seeded torrent (under 10 seeds) on a port forwarded connection. If I set a low upload speed limit say 1mib/s will I still be helping other peers/seeds who are not port forwarded find each other? What if I were to stop seeding would these people suddenly lose connection with each other or would they stay connected? Just curious because I'm trying to figure out exactly how port forwarding works.
Does seeding with port forwarding help other non port forwarded peers find each other?,"No, that is the job of the tracker and DHT/PeX swarms.

Port forwarding is just mapping a specific port or range of ports from an endpoint through to a specific device.  The primary use in torrenting is to connect to DHT/PeX swarms as those connections are initiated on the far end and will not have the needed NAT mappings to complete a connection to you otherwise."
Does seeding with port forwarding help other non port forwarded peers find each other?,"Theoretically yes but in practice I don't see peers who are connected to me upload between themselves too often.

Let's say peers don't initially see each other but can connect to you. After some time, you'll exchange your list of known peers with them (PEX), so they'll know there's someone. From there on:

1) Bittorrent's own UDP-based NAT hole punching. I still don't know how many clients support it. BiglyBT and anything based on libtorrent should (e.g. qB) - there you act as a middle man to help establish a connection.

2) Theoreeetically NAT hole punching just based on luck where unreachable peers send each other ""hello"" packets within a short period of time and that opens the connection between them

More often than not, peers already know about each other from DHT and tracker. The issue is they really can't connect to each other. If people don't have port-forwarding, you can't help them much other than seeding on your own. Don't obsess over it, instead spread the knowledge. I've pinned many guides and explanations on my profile and copy-pasting is welcome!"
Does seeding with port forwarding help other non port forwarded peers find each other?,"""maybe"" via DHT and list sharing the issue is if they can connect.

Mullvad VPN: Should you change ports frequently for privacy reasons?,"I recently switch to Mullvad for port forwarding and it's been amazing so far, especially for torrents.

I'm using the [haugene/transmission-openvpn]( container with a Mullvad VPN - and I'm trying to set up port-forwarding. My containers are successfully running behind a Traefik reverse proxy. 

Currently the listening port in Transmission settings is showing as **Closed**. 

Steps I've taken: 

* Activated a port in Mullvad settings - and entered the port # into Transmission 'peer listening port'
* Changed Transmission container *settings.json* `port-forwarding-enabled` to `true`
* Restarted the container

Any other ideas?

Error happening often on qBittorrent,"Sometimes a torrent turns red and the status reads as ""missing files."" It happens often and I hope someone knows what to do to fix it.

So far the only way I know how to fix it is to delete the torrent and start over again.

&#x200B;

I just noticed that all the torrents that turn red and say missing files don't have any seeders. When I started using qBittorent when there was no seeders it would say stalled but surely it's not a coincidence that they all show no seeders?"
Error happening often on qBittorrent,The only time it'll say missing files is if the downloaded files are gone or qbit can't see them.
Error happening often on qBittorrent,"That's because you're either moving or deleting them while the torrent is active.

To fix the error, after you either put the files back or de-select those you don't want to download/upload on content tab, right-click the torrent and do a force recheck."

Can someone pls explain this to me?,"I was reading an article mentioning the dangers of using a free proxy server. And didn’t understand this point. Can anyone pls explain this to me in more simple terms:

It Could Monitor Your Connection

In his article, Haschek goes on to theorize that the reason free proxy websites dislike using HTTPS is that they themselves want to monitor you. This isn't a far-fetched theory, as hackers have set up proxy servers in the past for this very reason.

When you use a free proxy website, you're trusting that the owners have set it up out of the kindness of their heart and won't use it as a honeypot to glean sensitive information. There's no way to know what the server owners installed on their hardware to monitor you, so it's not worth taking the gamble!"
Can someone pls explain this to me?,I don't know why this is here. Proxies and VPNs are 2 completely different things. Proxies only cover your browser while VPNs cover your entire machine and necessary for torrenting.

Got 2 AUP violations in a week because VPN is not masking connection?,"I have ExpressVPN and I can change the server connection at will. I have a kill switch turned on as well. I got an email from my ISP a week ago, and then another last night. It shows me exactly what was being torrented at the exact time, and what application was being used. I always check to make sure my IP is not my real public IP before torrenting, but somehow it keeps getting detected. What's going on? Is ExpressVPN showing my real location on purpose? Is there more I can do to mask my real IP?

EDIT: I went ahead a binded my ExpressVPN to QBittorrent using Method 1 on the pinned post on this subreddit. For some reason, ExpressVPN just names the connection Local Area Connection, and I had to constantly disable/enable it to see which one was ExpressVPN, and then I renamed the connection to be ExpressVPN, so I don't get confused.

Seeding torrents through VPN without port forwarding," I have spare bandwidth and I would like to seed my torrents. Only problem is, my VPN doesn't have a simple port forwarding solution. So, while a torrent is downloading, seeding speed is reasonable, however, once the download fully completes, seeding drops off gradually down to zero, I assume because qBittorrent isn't getting any incoming requests from peers.

Is there any solution to this? Perhaps to get qBittorrent to actively reach out to peers, rather than waiting for incoming connections? Because seeding seems to work once a connection has been established (such as while in the process of downloading)."

VPN recommendations for compatibility with T-Mobile Home Internet?,"So, I just got my T-Mobile 5G Home Internet service activated last week and it's very impressive, for the most part. It's much better/faster than my CenturyLink Internet service was, which I had been using for about the past 5 years (which seemed to be even slower than the 12Mbps speed that is is supposed to be capable of). However, I have run in to an issue, with regards to being able to get 'Connectable' in uTorrent, which is something that I haven't had issues with, literally, in many years. I mostly use uTorrent to download boxing matches from a boxing torrent site, that I've been a member of for over 16 years, and this is important to me.

I recently got a new (used) ASUS desktop computer and I almost immediately downloaded uTorrent (2.2.1) and, with my CenturyLink service, I didn't have any problems with being 'Connectable' in uTorrent. However, I have basically had nothing, but problems, with this issue with uTorrent, since I hooked up my T-Mobile Home Internet a few days ago.

I also want to say that I haven't ever used a VPN service, so I have no idea what to do, how to try to install it and get it turned on and working, nor which VPN service to choose. I have heard of Express VPN and Nord VPN, but I have literally no idea which service might be better, nor which options/features I might need, to help resolve this 'Not connectable' uTorrent issue. And that's why I am posting on here, to try to get some feedback and suggestions about which VPN service to try - assuming that getting a VPN might help me with my issue. Or, is signing up for a VPN service that I should get, regardless?

In case it matters, I have the Nokia 5G21 Gateway for my T-Mobile 5G Home Internet service, and my desktop computer is an ASUS PC with Windows 10 Pro on it, which is connected to the Nokia 5G Gateway via a Cat6 Networking cable, and I am using uTorrent 2.2.1.

So, with what I've described, will a VPN likely/possibly help to resolve this 'Not connectable' issue that I'm having in uTorrent? If so, which VPN service should I try? Is Express a good choice? Or Nord VPN? Are there cheaper, comparable options? And is there a VPN that has a good free trial offer?

Also, for the record, I just downloaded Qbittorrent and I am currently using it to download some torrents right now, but I am still having the same issue, when it comes to showing up as 'Connectable' on the boxing torrent site that I am downloading a fight from. So, evidently, the problem definitely has something to do with my T-Mobile Home Internet service and the way that it's connecting to the torrent site.

I've also come to realize that, apparently, port forwarding is going to be absolutely necessary for torrenting with fast speeds, but I don't think that I have ever actually had to even try to do that. So, if someone does reply to this post, if you could also try to help me a little, with how to get started on the port forwarding process, with whichever VPN service that is recommended, that would be fantastic.

If someone would please reply and help me try to resolve this issue, I would sincerely appreciate it."

VPN recommendations for compatibility with T-Mobile Home Internet?,"I've heard T-Mobile may block certain domains, but I've never experienced it from them myself. I have a DIY T-Mobile home internet setup (TTL mangling) without problem, so I'm betting DNS resolution fails for the trackers and that is the issue.  I don't use Windows, but I think they still have nslookup which you could use to confirm.

From Command Prompt, you could run two commands (replacing <TRACKER\_DOMAIN> with whatever tracker domain you are trying to connect to):  
`nslookup <TRACKER_DOMAIN>`  
`nslookup <TRACKER_DOMAIN>` [`1.1.1.1`](

If the first one fails and the second succeeds, then whatever T-Mobile provides your machine for DNS needs to be changed.  You should still run this kind of thing through a VPN (which would also fix that as VPNs push their own DNS settings typically)."

VPN recommendations for compatibility with T-Mobile Home Internet?,
VPN recommendations for compatibility with T-Mobile Home Internet?,"T-Mobile (and all the other 5G services, hotspots, etc) are IPv6-first, with CG-NAT for IPv4.  IOW, you cannot set port forwarding on IPv4, since you share that IP with countless other users.  IPv6 would probably work, but relatively few peers are configured to even allow that.

&#x200B;

A VPN with port forwarding would bypass this, since you have an outgoing connection to VPN, and they can receive your incoming connection and pass it along to you.  Some will say they don't need it, which is debatable - for P2P to work, one side must be connectable, but it doesn't really matter which.  If you are exclusively connecting to seedboxes and the like, they will always be connectable, and it won't matter.  But you will also run into torrents with few seeds where you simply can't reach anyone else, so you can't get the content."
VPN recommendations for compatibility with T-Mobile Home Internet?,I personally use expressvpn and in the settings I turn on the killswitch so if the VPN randomly disconnects it turns off the internet on your computer. When that happens just pause whatever you are downloading and then you can troubleshoot what's going on. I also use qbit torrent. No ads and never had an issue. Also expressvpn is very user friendly
VPN recommendations for compatibility with T-Mobile Home Internet?,"I'm assuming that you're in the US, in which case I would highly recommend giving Windscribe a try.  Very affordable (with a custom pro plan) and they have a ton of US based servers that give me great speeds.  I use them with tmo 5G (I know, not the same thing, but still tmo network) very successfully and have been pleased with their service.  I evaluated Mullvad as it seems to be a fan favorite on Reddit, but the speeds for me (in the US) left a lot to be desired.

weird claims ( 2-7x faster )

claims 24/7 protection even without a connection lol how ? the basic thing for a vpn to work is literarily connection

>You’re always connected, **no need to connect** or disconnect (like other VPNs)

Makes wrong claims about other VPN.

Aka none of the 3 other vpn they named in the screenshot run at these speeds. they all run at 240mbit/s speed ( tested by myself )

I've tried surfshark Atlanta, Toronto, Brazil, and Madrid. Tested downloading a Linux torrent with VPN off, works fine. Tested several torrents with VPN enabled, and it won't connect to even download the torrent metadata. Anybody know if Kickass actively blocks VPN services (or perhaps just Surfshark)?"
VPN blocking?,Forbidden easily points to that they banned the Server IP.
VPN blocking?,"I just ditched surfshark, theres other sites that have blocked them as well. I was with them for 2 years. I then went with Nord recently only to find out they also suck, thankfully found this sub and learned a ton. Cancelled Nord within 30 days. Im now trying Mullvad for a month."
VPN blocking?,Stop using using http and start using built in search. Qbit has a surprisingly great search plugin system.
VPN blocking?,"If you're using Surfshark's DNS servers, you should check DNS resolution against the kickass domain first using either `nslookup` or `dig` commands both connected to the VPN and disconnected from it.  Check for differences (specifically while connected as that is not working for you).  Also, you might try pinging the returned IP addresses to see if they are reachable (again look for differences in results).  

403 Forbidden could mean Kickass is blocking your IP or it could be redirection on Surfshark's side.  You might also consider testing using one of the kickass proxies as those should maintain their own blocklists."
Torrenting in Canada,"Is a VPN absolutely necessary for torrenting in Canada?

I received a letter once in the past while downloading before I had a VPN and then didn't receive one while my VPN subscription was still good over the last three years. I would mostly download movies and shows, sometimes games. It has since expired and I haven't torrented anything since then.

Are the risks great enough to warrant actually needing a VPN in Canada or is it mostly just smoke and mirrors type stuff? Meaning nothing would actually happen as a result of torrenting/downloading without a VPN.

Split tunnelling for server + torrent client?,"Hi, I am running a RPI as a internet-facing media server with caddy as reverse proxy.

Is there a way of using wireguard + Mullvad to route only the torrent traffic through the VPN - but to still have my site available at my home (static) IP?

"Been out the game for a while, are these the speeds I should expect? If not, what can I do to improve?",Check you don’t have alternative speed limits enabled. Look at the bottom of qBitorrent.

VPN router for my work computer?,"Hi,

I am from India and I have been working from home since covid. My office doesn't resume until September and I am planning to spend a couple of months in London. My company has a policy of not allowing its employees to work from outside India.

I use BIG-IP Edge on my work laptop to connect to my company's network. I don't want my office to know that I am not in the country.

Do I need to buy a VPN router and set up a VPN connection on the router or is it okay if I don't use a VPN service to hide my location since I will be logging in through BIG-IP on my work laptop.

Will they find out that I am in the UK even though I am logging in through BIG IP on my work laptop.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you"
VPN router for my work computer?,"Not exactly related to VPN and torrents, but in your case I'd probably get a raspberry pi and set up a VPN at home which you can connect from abroad. This way you'll have same residential IP as before and you can bypass any security checks they might have. 

Then yes, getting a portable Wi-Fi router connected to said home VPN. 

That said, can't really advise going through with this. You may lose your job if you're found out and I've seen this happen before. Even with VPN plenty can go wrong. Good luck"
VPN router for my work computer?,[deleted]
VPN router for my work computer?,"Yes, a vpn router is an excellent choice.  Solid choice.  Inexpensive and easy too.

You have many options for routers and vpn services.  If you don't have high throughput requirements (high speed), then a travel router (google it) would suffice, and use any major vpn service (like mullvad) that has servers everywhere.

If you need a higher performance router, you'll spend hundreds of dollars, but there are choices there too.  Pre-built ones cost more, but custom (do it yourself) with linux are faster.

If you don't want to use a known vpn provider, you can use a VPS provider (like vultr or linode) and rent a remote vps server (usually $5/month) then install linux and openvpn or wireguard on it, plenty of how-to's out there for this.  The VPS providers usually have a pre-built vpn server you can install.  This way, you'll have your own private vpn server.

I've done all of the above.  They all work.  Any will do what you need easily."

That's similar to those workplaces, where you just log into over a browser, in order to work, while the OS is running from some server farm and your PC is just a client, no matter how slow/fast it is.

So, beside using a private-VPN through your home address, I would consider having a plan B, in case you have no one, who can look after your devices, while you are absent."

Mullvad with qBittorrent has suddenly become really slow.,Did you change your settings to use wireguard only? Make sure you connect to city near you. And enable port forwarding for torrenting. That's the main reason for switching to Mullvad in the first place. I switched from NordVPN and my speeds are marginely slower but I max out my speeds much more often with Mullvad while torrenting because I can connect to 5x as many peers/seeds. My speeds are normally 500mbps/500mbps down and up and I get maybe 450/450 on mullvad on occasion reaching up to 500. I have been having issues with connections on the Mullvad android app tho. I think it may have to do with MTU size. I lowered it on android and so far seems to be no issues. I recommend adjusting your MTU size on your PC Mullvad settings as well to maximize your connection.

"PIA often creates different UTUN #, so how can I force QBitTorrent to use PIA's current tunnel interface?","Whenever I restart PIA, it often creates / uses a different tunnel number.

Sometimes it's utun**3**, or utun**5**, etc.

I hear that to be most secure, you must tell QBitTorrent to use PIA's tunnel numer, not ""Any interface"".

Like so, in QBT:

    Settings > Advanced > Network Interface = the utun # that PIA has created this time

But what ends up happening is that often QBT isn't downloading or seeding anything.

Why not? Because PIA is using a different tunnel number this time.

How can I ensure PIA and QBT are always in sync?"

Can anyone direct me what exactly I need to change in Avast? I found the application rules for the 4 Mullvad programs, but I'm pretty lost at this point as to how to set these items up.

Thanks for any help

New to Mullvad and having port forward issues,"I *finally* got the Mullvad port forward to work with Avast Premier.

My first issue in this saga with was a Mullvad leaky DNS. If you have Avast Premier, then go into *Protection*, then *Real Site*, turn **OFF** *Support encrypted DNS is browsers*, then hit the settings wheel cog to the right, and turn **OFF** *Real Site,* and select **Until I turn on again**.

 I  did a *Allow apps to communicate through Windows Defender Firewall* , where I added **Mullvad VPN.exe**, and marked it both Public and Private. (Thanks Pump-Chaser!) 

The most notable was in the Application Rules, the actual program ***Mullvad VPN.exe*** was not included. I feel a bit chagrined that I didn't notice it's absence sooner.

I added it in the **Application Rules**. I allowed a Internet In and out for TCP/UPN, and added a general Allow all Protocol rule for all Mullvad apps listed in the Application Rules. You should have **5 app rules in total**.  

I'm guessing the App rule is what did it, but thought I'd include all of my steps here for the next person dealing with crappy Avast issues.

Hope this helps someone as clueless as I am about this stuff"

VPN dies when torrenting too fast,"My VPN keeps disconnecting (I use mullvad) whenever torrents download ""too fast"". I have a 250mbps connection both ways so it has the potential to go pretty fast. But unless i limit my torrent client (qBittorent) to about 15 MiB/s or it will disconnect constantly, although at that speed is still does drop on occascion. I have to put it all the way down to 5 MiB/s to have it download without any disconnects whatsoever. This seems to be a VPN issue as there's no disconnects when not using the VPN, but I dont want to expose my IP.  


What can i do to fix this, or does Mullvad just not support my internet speed?"
VPN dies when torrenting too fast,"Very unlikely to be a Mullvad issue. I have 10g symmetric internet and also use Mullvad. No issue here. I get about ~750mbps/900mbps while on the VPN.

Try switching server. If the problem persist then it's something on your end.

Something doesn't sound right though. Why would qbittorrent bandwidth cause a VPN disconnect?"
VPN dies when torrenting too fast,"That doesn't sound right.  Speed shouldn't have anything to do with it.  Did you contact mullvad support?  They are pretty good.

I have mullvad, and my router connects my entire home network to mullvad vpn, I can flood the 400mb/s ISP link all day long with wireguard traffic, no problems here at all.  Runs perfectly."
VPN dies when torrenting too fast,"Reducing speed can fix non speed issues, I’ve had an SSD lock up from to many simultaneously writes overheating it. 

So check all your hardware + maxed connections. That can overwhelm your router. Try dropping the max connections in 20% increments."
VPN dies when torrenting too fast,I actually have this issue with my isp and not my vpn . How I fixed it for myself was to do a speed test without a vpn and then go to my router settings and set the qos to throttle to a slightly slower speed than my results from the speed test . This seems to have fixed my issue.
VPN dies when torrenting too fast,Reduce your max global connections in your torrent client and make sure you're running the 64 bit version. I have 500mbps/500mbps. I can max it all day everyday on mullvad with no issues.

Mullvad sounds great, especially after Monero... But they have no ZA servers AFAIK.

Cloudflare WARP works well for speed, but is apparently just as good as no vpn."
Speed issues - CyberGhost,"I'm having speed issues with torrenting through VPN. I understand that I would sacrifice a bit of a performance hit with VPN use and that it would differ between VPN companies, but I'm getting about 1/10th of the speed (I'd think about 50% dropoff would be reasonable). I have chosen the closest server to me under the Torrenting list (and also tried 3 other countries with the same issue) and I cannot get speeds over 1MB/s. When I turn VPN off I can get speeds up to 12MB/s. I am using Wireguard protocol. I have a link to a video showing the speed issue below:

  
  
From 0.00-0.30 is speed with no VPN

From 0.30-1.09 is speed with CyberGhost

From 1.09 to end is speed with no VPN again"
Speed issues - CyberGhost,Cyberghost lacks port-forwarding which could explain the crap speed if the torrent doesn't have too many seeders/peers.
Speed issues - CyberGhost,"Cyber ghost was good 8 years ago, they got a extremely declining speed and got bought by kape which is alarming in itself. 

In my internal tests they peak 110mbit with an average 66mbit.

You should really invest in a better vpn.

The average ( on non slow hardware of you ) is a hit of 1-7% max on good vpn.

Ofc on most routers you will get a hit of 50% or even more cause of the weak hardware even with wireguard. But not on most average modern phones or desktops."
Speed issues - CyberGhost,Any suggestions for providers with decent speed and cost ratio? What's the popular choice these days for a VPN provider?
Speed issues - CyberGhost,"UPDATE:

So I moved over to Mullvad after troubleshooting with Cyberghost support and never getting better than 9MB down/9MB up. After installing the Mullvad VPN, I connected to my closest location and again, 9MB/9MB speed! I tried a different country, slightly worse but similar. VPN off - 108MB down/35MB up. Seems the issue may not have been CyberGhost, but rather there is a 'block' or something with either my ISP or router? I'm using a Linksys EA8500 running DD-WRT (build 47976) with the PC connected via ethernet. I'm going to see about configuring the router to use the OpenVPN config and see if I get the same results. I'll also try my phone with mullvad app on both my WiFi and Mobile data and see what happens there.

Any other thoughts or suggestions?"

Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,"Using a VPN for torrenting is sort of like using a fire hose to water your lawn.  Sure, it works,  But if you're not really careful, it could cause more problems than it solves.  With so much pressure you could over water or even damage the turf.  With a VPN you can use torrents privately and safely, but a VPN can cause other problems too.  Search engines get confused by your location, websites like banking often won't work, because your browsing traffic is unnecessarily going through the VPN too.  For most people, a VPN is overkill for torrenting, but it's they only way the know how to protect their privacy.  But there is another option.

A SOCKS5 proxy, like a VPN, allows you to torrent anonomyously.  But unlike a VPN, a SOCKS5 proxy is configured inside your torrenting application, and only protects your torrenting traffic.  All your other internet usage, like browsing, email, etc. is unaffected.  SOCKS5 is also faster, and a bit safer too.  It's safer because if a SOCKS5 connection fails while torrenting the torrenting stops.  With a VPN, if it fails the torrent can continue unprotected without special ""kill switch"" features.

Why don't more people use SOCKS5?  It's complicated.  While SOCKS5 is a better solution for many people, there are some scenarios where it's not.  SOCKS5 provides anonymity, it does not provide encryption.  That means that your internet provide could see your traffic.  Depending on where you live, and what you're torrenting, that may or may not matter.  For example, if you're in the USA downloading a new movie you probably don't care.  In other countries, torrenting is throttled, or blocked entirely.  Another disadvantage of SOCKS5 is that it's not as good uploading, so if that's important to you you'd want to stick with a VPN.

In summary, if all you want to do is torrent anonymously and not get sued, then a SOCKS5 proxy may be the way to go."
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,"Except SOCKS5 proxy has worse performance than a VPN when you factor the lack of port-forwarding and it's not safer than a VPN with binded interface to the torrent client. In short, SOCKS5 presents no benefits compared to a VPN for torrenting performance and security.

Besides that, a VPN has a ton of other benefits like concealing your traffic and requests from your ISP and other agents along the network, bypassing geolocked content, adding an extra security layer for MITM attacks on unencrypted traffic, DNS with anti-malware/tracking filters, the list goes on.

Plus I have used VPNs for like 10 years and never faced issues with banking or ""search engines getting confused"". But if this is something you're worried about, just split tunnel and have a browser specific for non-VPN traffic, problem solved."
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,Split tunneling. VPN only for the torrent client and bound to it. All problems solved.
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,"Alternatively, you can set up your VPN to work with only your torrent client. 

I use binhex qbittorrent-vpn Docker container."
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,i... turn my vpn off when not torrenting since it and netflix are my only uses for it. problem solved
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,i dont really get where the advantage would be when using an proxy... just bind qtorrent to your vpn internet adapter and you are safe.
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,"I just run a vpn and torrent program within a docker instance. 

I don't see any downside to this.   I get the VPN ""free"" through a Usenet subscription that I have.  i don't get a proxy for ""free."""
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,My docker containers attach to vpn container network for torrents. I don’t use them for personal use.
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,"Not to mention some socks5 proxies only work with the client, such as mullvad."
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,"Different strokes for different folks.

I only torrent on occasion, but I keep my entire home network connected to a high speed vpn server, to keep my ISP from logging every damn thing I do, then SELLING the info to governments, corporations, advertisers, without my permission, because Congress (here in the US) authorized them to do so.

Some can argue that the vpn provider can do the same thing, and even though that might be happening in some situations, it's practically guaranteed that your ISP is doing it.

For paranoid people looking to hide, there's always double hop vpn, or tor over vpn, or yes, even proxies have their place.

I just don't like ""the man"" spying on me without my permission, and I'm not going to make it any easier for 'em.

Oh, and I might torrent on occasion too.  It's a free perk."
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,The few problems that VPNs cause are minimal compared to the privacy benefits in this era of data collection. I have no problem not using any Google products any more.
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,"I don't trust the dns servers of cloudflare Or Opendns Or Cloud9 etc. 
I do trust my VPNs own dns server which also has pi-hole like malware and ad blocking features built in.
Socks5 not being encrypted traffic is a deal breaker. Plus, these days modern cpu's easily crunch openvpn or wireguard protocols with no noticable performance hit whatsoever. 
It also is just safer to a lot of paid vpn customers that want all of their traffic protected."
Why You Shouldn't Be Using a VPN for Torrenting,"This is a stupid post. lol. ""you shouldn't need a VPN because it provides more features then you need and people are too lazy to set it up properly"" sums it up pretty much.   


""Another disadvantage of SOCKS5 is that it's not as good uploading, so if that's important to you you'd want to stick with a VPN""

Considering that this part is pretty critical to how torrenting thrives. I would say it's pretty damn important.

Why Mullvad VPN?,"Quick query…why is Mullvad so good?
My ExpressVPN sub ends shortly, and I’ve seen on here that Mullvad is the Community favourite…but why?
I’ve looked at reviews and Mullvad either doesn’t get mentioned or doesn’t rate highly…so why is it the community favourite?
I do Torrent and ExpressVPN has done me well so far, they are expensive but it seems to work
More than happy to change but Ned reasons why…
Thank you"
Why Mullvad VPN?,"Very often, those reviews are made by people who participate in VPN affiliate schemes, and get money if people sign up for a VPN service using their link. Mullvad doesn't have a referral programme, which is why they get mentioned less and less positively in reviews.

Mullvad is a favourite because of their transparent and clean approach. Like I said, they don't create dishonest reviews because they do not have a referral programme. Also, their software is open source so their no-log and security claims are closer to being verifiable. They haven't had any security slip-ups. Additionally, their pricing is the opposite of misleading.

These reasons, among probably some other things I missed, make them a company that's easy to trust."
Why Mullvad VPN?,"Thank you for your replies everyone…I made the switch last night to Mullvad, initially on a one month subscription. 

Someone mentioned port forwarding for Torrenting but it doesn’t work on Subscription. Is port forwarding worth it? Will it speed things up?"

Why Mullvad VPN?,">I’ve looked at reviews and Mullvad either doesn’t get mentioned or doesn’t rate highly…so why is it the community favourite?

99% of the reviews are paid. Something that isn't high in reviews, but favored by the community, shows that it is independent, doesn't buy fake reviews and is judged to be good."
Why Mullvad VPN?,"Agree, most of the VPN review websites are just fake, as they rate the best providers on top of who pays the best affiliates. Mullvad does not pay anyone to recommend their services.  [Bitcoin VPN]( recommends Mullvad, also OVPN. 2 best Sweden VPN services."

Easy to use on my Android phone, iPad and W11 pc. However, my network adapter stopped working after I uninstalled it. The FAQ recommended turning IPv4 back on. Did that, no change. Reinstalled, got my connection back. Hmm. Uninstalled, connection broke again. 

So I contacted customer service and they were fast and helpful but I eventually had to reset Windows to get my connection back. It was definitely some kind of protocol issue but they never fixed it and they had no idea how to. 

Still, it was cheap and it works. Just don't ever unsub, lol."
Why Mullvad VPN?,"I like azirevpn. There is no port forwarding but it otherwise meets the privacy tests.

The old honest VPN privacy reviewer marked it high

Cheaper than Mullivad and performs well"
Why Mullvad VPN?,Just test it out. I had no idea what to pick so I just picked mullvad VPN. It's cheap and gets the job done with no issues for me anyway.
Why Mullvad VPN?,"I use AirVPN, but I've heard nothing but good things about mullvad"
Why Mullvad VPN?,"Super unpopular opinion on here, but I tried MullVad for a month, and it was too slow to reliably stream. I'm not overly concerned about privacy, I just want to stream sports from America.

"Mullvlad on Synology Enough To Prevent ""IP Reputation Attacks""?","I moved into a new apartment with a new roommate. We get our internet from Xfinity and use the Xfinity provided router.  Since my roommate set up the internet, he's been getting notifications on his Xfinity app that my NAS is suffering from ""IP Reputation"" attacks and that Advanced Security has blocked 25 high security risks. Now obviously this is from running qBittorrent on it.

So my current solution to prevent these notifications from popping up anymore has been:
1. Signed up for Mullvlad 
2. Created a VPN connection on my synology to Mullvlad.
3. On my Synology qBittorrent docker container, I've set the interface to be binded to the VPN connection in Synology's control panel.

So far, I've done some test torrents with ipleak.net's torrent address detection function and it appears that the IP address is returning the server from Mullvlad. Am I correct to assume this setup will prevent more ""IP Reputation attacks"" from showing up on my roommate's Xfinity app?"
"Mullvlad on Synology Enough To Prevent ""IP Reputation Attacks""?",Yeah if you are using a vpn the torrent traffic should route to a datacenter instead of your friends router. Also don't rent Xfinity's modem as it is expensive on a monthly basis and you can buy a cable modem upfront instead of renting one.

I'd like some help/advice on an automated torrenting solution for a stream server (Plex),"Hey everyone, 

I've been really struggling here with coming up with a system where I can have a way to use a VPN, and (hopefully) automatically torrent TV shows and movies to a hard drive while also having Plex running at the same time. I'm not extremely tech savvy, but I have read up on a lot of different solutions like using a Hyper-V VM on windows 10 running Sonarr and a VPN (so I can separate the VPN from the Plex server). But I'm running into a problem with having my 10tb external HD being only accessible by *either* my main computer *or* the VM which wont do since Plex on the main instance needs to read the HD, but the VM needs to have it too so it can deposit the files it torrents. I could solve that issue by getting a VPN that can split tunnel so only the automated torrenting programs would be run through the VPN, but I still haven't been able to automate the process yet either. 

I've also read up dockers and on Binhex's DelugeVPN, but I don't really understand it to be able to tackle it.  

If possible, I would like to keep using Windows 10, but if there is an easy way to do all of this for a moderately tech savvy person like me, then I'm all for it Linuxing it up. At this point, I'm down to start from scratch if I have an attainable way to do what I mentioned wanting to do.  

  
 

So:  

(1) how do/would you guys automate torrenting while also streaming the torrented media from the same computer on Plex? 

(2) do you have any advice on what I should do?  

  
 

I've spent every hour of free time for a solid week trying to figure this all out after my last computer died and I wanted to upgrade. My family and friends that use my Plex server haven't been able to enjoy it for a week now. 

  
 

I *really* appreciate the help in advance!"
I'd like some help/advice on an automated torrenting solution for a stream server (Plex),"I use binhex qbittorrent-vpn running in a Docker container in Windows 10.

The only app you need running behind a VPN is your torrent client. I recommend qBittorrent. 

You need Sonarr, Radarr and Prowlarr. I have these and Plex all running on the same Windows 10 PC as Docker."
I'd like some help/advice on an automated torrenting solution for a stream server (Plex),"I was adamant to configure my setup in such a way that I could use my VPN for qBitTorrent and Firefox but everything else through my default interface/adapter. That’s to say I configured a split tunnel but wanted to make sure I was using WireGuard for the 10x speeds I was able to get.

Took some finagling but eventually got it all properly set up such that I can use WireGuard for qBit and Firefox while seeding, and the option of my default interface or another VPN server for changing my browser’s location."
I'd like some help/advice on an automated torrenting solution for a stream server (Plex),">  my 10tb external HD being only accessible by either my main computer or the VM

This is solved by the VM software binding your HDD as a network share for the guest.

Host: full control over HDD

Guest: Accesses host's HDD (actually a folder path) by having access to it as a ""network share"" with read/write access.

This works flawlessly on Virtualbox, VMWare"

will a wintun driver cause issue with qbittorrent,"My Vpn which is Airvpn as of its leatest update uses wintun instead of tap driver by default.

I have qbt bound to my vpn under network interfaces so it wont download until vpn is connected.

1. nord doesn't port forward, and never will, they say ""it's a security problem"", so if you torrent, there are better services
2. nord only allows wireguard if you use their proprietary client, couldn't connect my router to nord with wireguard
3. nord only has one dns service, mullvad offers 4 different dns servers: regular dns server, ad blocking server, tracker blocking server, and the one I use: an ad blocking + tracker blocking dns server.  It's basically a free pihole service.

I will give nord credit for it's tv streaming services, which seem to be better than others (for now), but I live in the US, so I don't really need to stream things like netflix, which I won't anymore anyways because it's the same limited lineup crap as all the other streaming services."

Seeding but not uploading - Deluge behind VPN through Docker,"Hi All,

I'm relatively new at this so it's very possible I'm making some kind of dumb mistake.  I currently have deluge in a stack with dperson/openvpn-client to run through a PIA vpn (I used [ as a basic guide).  Things seem to be working quite well and I'm able to download torrents without any problems (and my external IP is the vpn), however I've noticed that in spite of seeding a number of torrents, I never actually upload anything.  I'm wondering if this is a port issue, but I'm just not sure how to diagnose the problem.  

I'm running on a synology NAS.  Would appreciate any insights!"
Seeding but not uploading - Deluge behind VPN through Docker,Are you getting the port number from PIA and setting it in deluge?
Seeding but not uploading - Deluge behind VPN through Docker,"Perhaps there are enough seeds serving the torrents.

If you want to check that the ports are indeed open, you can do something that will require more skill..

If you are familiar with Linux tools like netcat you can open a port and listen from the docker container using netcat on that port.

```
docker exec -ti dockerid -- bash
nc -l 54321
```

Then from another terminal you try to connect to the VPN external IP of thee machine on the port you opened. 

```
nc vpnip -p 54321

curious about people's opinions on Mozilla VPN.,"I use it for my day to day browsing for a few reasons, primarily because it's fast, cheap, and has multi hop. Plus, Mozilla is a non profit with some killer software that they make free, so they're a company I don't mind throwing a few dollars at.

2. Perfect-Privacy's or Astrill's StealthVPN 
3. Cryptostorm with HTTPS/TLS or obfs4 
4. Self-hosted v2ray server + TLS + Cloudflare CDN (avoid hosts like Digital Ocean, Vultr or Linode)"
SSTP vpn providers,"If you are okay with the linux command prompt, or willing to learn, I'd suggest you rent a remote virtual server for $5/month, from a vps provider like linode or vultr, turn up your own remote linux server, turn it into your own private vpn server, then do some testing.

Install sstp on it.  Also install openvpn and wireguard.  Set them up as servers.  Get comfortable with the config options.  Then do throughput testing, change things, to see which performs the best.

You can continue to use it as your own private vpn server, or you can also subscribe to a major vpn provider, and use their service.

I started with my own private vpn server on a vps, so I could do testing, but I still have it, even though I currently use the mullvad vpn service too.  It's been convenient remote testing my mullvad vpn service, like checking the port forwarding options, stuff like that."

Socks5 proxy,"Hey , please I need a website that sell socks , I use to buy my socks from luxsocks but the site is banned . I need a site whereby I can deposit btc to buy socks . Any help ."
Socks5 proxy,"Socks is an internet protocol that routes your traffic through a remote proxy. It makes you anonymous by changing your IP. You can use it to bypass internet restrictions and access content unavailable at your location. 

Socks5 proxy has many useful features, like a smart authentication system, no traffic limitations, fast speeds due to the UDP protocol, as well as good performance on P2P websites and various platforms. However, you should always use a VPN, too. 

Here's a video explaining a bit more ["
Socks5 proxy,"I'm assuming you mean SOCKS5 as a complement to VPN, not standalone (in which case check it's an obvious no).

SOCKS5 only makes sense in one specific scenario - split tunnel where you only want to whitelist some apps and the VPN client app doesn't have this feature. 

Besides that it's either useless (eg. binding is much better for preventing leaks) or downright harmful (breaks port-forwarding in most VPNs that support it, except maybe for hide.me)."
Socks5 proxy,"I have limited experience with it, but that's because my experience wasn't particularly good. I set up SOCKS5 in Qbittorrent, as it was supposed to increase privacy according to the guide, and since I enjoy privacy I thought it was a great idea. Perhaps it did increase my privacy, but it also made using P2P very difficult, as peers were difficult to connect to. So in my case with P2P, it was a negative experience."

"Trying to figure out if my IP is showing, and none of the commonly recommended methods are working","So I googled how to check my own IP on torrents (qbittorrent), and there are a bunch of ""use this magnet link, and the IP it sees will show up"" websites, and none of them are working for me. Not torguard.net, ipleak.net, ipmagnet.services.cbcdn.com, checkmyip.torrentprivacy.com, etc.

I know my torrent client is working because it's downloading other things. I just want to know if it's my home or VPN IP. What is causing this, and what other ways are there of checking my outward facing IP?"
"Trying to figure out if my IP is showing, and none of the commonly recommended methods are working",yep the ip he has written down will be his real and what ipleaks should report will be a fake one from his vpn server and both hopefully will be very different or am i missing something here?
"Trying to figure out if my IP is showing, and none of the commonly recommended methods are working","Without the VPN on, go to the command prompt or Powershell and type ipconfig. Write down your IPv4 address. This your IP address.

With the VPN on, go to ipleak.net. If the address is different on the top, in the DNS and no WebRTC leaks, you're good to go. Period"

2. The FBI don't come to your door. Media companies scour torrents for IP addresses and make claims to your ISP who in turn contact you.

Use a VPN and follow these steps to stay safe.

*1 Never have the torrent program start with Windows.

*2 Always have the VPN on before the torrent program

*3 Always turn the torrent program off before the VPN.

*4.Check the Task Manager to be sure the torrent app is
   off before turning off the VPN."

Psiphon-is it good for torrenting,Dont use psiphon for torrent... They're a free vpn and usually sell your data...
Psiphon-is it good for torrenting,"[ not a good review, also with most free Vpn's they are free because they log data in 1 way or another or have slow speed or a very low bandwidth cap, so the trick is finding 1 thats free and does not do any of that and also does not care what you do with it.

Dewvpn ([   its been around for at least 2 year but the surprising thing is nobody seems to talk about it or may even know it exists ""i found it by accident when i was getting annoyed with tunnel and others"" as it does not need to advertise to keep itself free and instead rely's on word of mouth and also other company's can not make money off the back of it with bundling etc because its 100% free and always has been and has all the power of a full blown cash paid for product but with 0 monthly subscription or 1 years costs.

It does not log your data and has 2 stages of how it works which i will explain in a moment, there is no bandwidth cap at all unlike other free ones ive used and you have loads of country's to choose from.                                                                                                                      
It seems to be happy with most firewalls when you install it Except for Tinyfirwall and it's clones where you can just add it to the whitelist or create a acceptation for it to work and you may have to do this again if it updates as Tiny is good but a pain in the arse lol and has the same problem with discord live updates as well.

Now as i mentioned it has 2 stages and this is why i like it as it was designed with 2 power levels especially with the Torrent user in mind.

Level 1 mode: This is full blown mode running from you clicking your desktop icon which you do for the first ever install or to select country or to be 100% vpn covered no matter what your doing on the Pc etc.                                                                                                       
Level  2 mode: This is the one i really like, after you have installed and used the program the next time you reboot your system up Dewvpn sits quietly in the background and watches for your torrent software download list if running and then auto kicks in when needed in low mode and just covers the downloads and nothing else meaning you can still use the web as normal or play games and it does not effect your speed ""subject to a good internet connection speed of course "" and you know your still safe.

I've tested it on a old i3 PC with 2mb net speed while torrenting 25 gig up and down and playing a game all at the same time.                                                                                            
What this means for example is say you have a entire series you want to download but your vpn in full power mode slows down your connection using utorrentweb for example, so you just select what you want to download and start it under full power mode 1 and then reboot the pc and mode 2 takes over once booted up and does all your up and downing loading in the background while you get on with things and you will get a popup notification when downloading a torrent has finished at normally the maximum speed of what ever your net connection is rather than the lag.                                                                    
  
So give it a try and enjoy the speed and safety and a free vpn.

P.s. the tinyfirwall i mentioned earlier is also 100% free and very easy to use and setup.

Pss. I've not tried this with a streaming setup as i only download things and cant see the point of streaming if you cant keep the items or have that option ;) also if you re-watch the stream you may as well have downloaded it in the first place with no internet interruptions or more data off your monthly limit if you have one but most connections these days are unlimited and even mobile contracts are 60 gig plus standards these day."

Very low DL speeds," Hi all,

newbie to the sub but have been torrenting for years.  I'm not a techie though so it's mostly a black box to me, any answers that go in depth under the hood will need to ELI5 I'm afraid.

Just this week I started up again after a year or so's hiatus.  I am in the UK, with BT, but using a VPN. I have uTorrent (I know no longer considered ""the best"" but it's what I'm familiar with).

Firstly I feel like the typical number of seeders and seeder/peer ratios has plummeted since last I was active (\~mid 2021).  Is this accurate?

More importantly, I'm having absolutely no luck in getting more than 2.1Mbps DL rate, MAXIMUM, and often lower.  I've run a speed test whilst the VPN is active and it shows I have 22.5Mbps, so it's just my torrent client that is super-slow.  I can't recall my average DL speed when I was last torrenting but it was definitely a LOT higher.  I know uTorrent is not the fastest, but this feels like something bigger going on... or is uTorrent really **that** bad now?  ...bearing in mind it's the same client I was using a year ago without any problem.

Does anyone have any suggestions or insight?

Thanks"
Very low DL speeds,"How does uTorrent report download speed? Is it mbps or MB/s? Speed tests use mbps, or megaBITS per second. Most torrent clients use MB/s, or megaBYTES per second. One megaBYTE is 8 megaBITS, so 22.5 mbps is around 2.8 MB/s."
Very low DL speeds,"Also, use qBitTorrent. It probably won’t solve your dl speeds problems, but it is the best client."

Then you are good to go!."
I'm asking because I don't know torrent well., Don’t ever expect a vpn to shield you from serious criminal activity. If you are extorting someone or distributing kiddie pron all law enforcement needs to get a warrant and then they will be waiting for you and don’t expect your vpn provider no matter who it is to shield you. BS DMCA violations are one thing. Crimes that involve underage kids in a sexual nature or even money and drugs are quite something else. Can’t say most people in this sub won’t be rooting for you to get busted if you are involved in serious criminal activities.

I downloaded a torrent without a vpn,"Many extremes here. Some say you'll be fine, others you'll get a big fine.

As always, truth is in the middle. To understand, you need to know how it all works. If the company that made the thing you downloaded cares enough to catch people who upload it and fine them, they will have placed a tracker in the torrent that can easily show them the IP addresses of downloaders and uploaders. They can then pay a lawyer to get a court order and send it to the ISP to ask for your details as the holder of the offending IP address. The ISP will naturally comply. Once they have your details, the lawyer sends you a letter to say something like ""you downloaded my client's thing, either pay $1000 or we will take you to court and you'll have to pay more.""

They tried that in the UK in the past with very very little success, I think they managed to catch one person overall, and only because it went to court and the person never showed up. In most cases, if you ignored the letter you were fine (but that was no guarantee). It was later shown in the High Court that obtaining user IP addresses like that was illegal or somehow not allowed in UK law.

The other thing they mostly do nowadays is let your ISP know, and the ISP sends you a warning. ISP policies vary, but many would have something like a 3-strike system, after 3 warnings your speed might be reduced or your ISP may terminate your account.

If you do get a warning from your ISP, see what their policy is - the good thing is it usually just stops there."

I had Comcast for a couple years, never used a VPN, and got several notices, but that was it, no threatening of disconnect or anything.

VPN suggestions,"Hey. So I currently have tried Proton's free version and Mullvad. I really like Mullvad and have nothing but a good experience in my month of trying it, but I'd like to get a years worth of VPN service and was wondering what other vpns yearly rates have good deals?

Might stick to Mullvad since I know they work and it's still a relatively good price, but the conversion rates add a few dollars and I'm broke... so I'd like to get some other suggestions. I'm also using VPN just for browsing/streaming videos and gaming, to help lower my ping. I've noticed Mullvad lowers my ping by 10-20ms in games, while Proton increases my ping by 40ms.

Expressvpn or Mullvad?,Express leaked my DNS and I got a copyright infringement notice from Paramount. Fuck them. I moved to Mullvad haven't looked back.
Expressvpn or Mullvad?,Expressvpn is not recommended because it is overpriced and doesn't even support Wireguard in 2022
Expressvpn or Mullvad?,"Honestly? I'd choose [Celo.net](

I'm not a evangelist of them, it's just they have the best customer support and their servers max out my connection. I really like them."
Expressvpn or Mullvad?,"neither to be honest as you have to pay for both. I suggest dewvpn has 2 modes full blown and torrent monitor and is 100% free no data logging and no data caps for life.                           
In full mode all is covered and has been well tested against leakage with great results where as torrent mode just covers torrents while your free to get on doing everything else without lags."

On Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 as a vpn,"With some basic testing, it appears it does work on masking your ip on torrents with WARP mode. On dns only mode, it seems like it doesn't work with torrents (on my device). 

Is anyone with more time willing to do further testing? If it does work, then it would be a huge resource as it is completely unlimited."
On Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 as a vpn,"WARP does function as a VPN, with the biggest difference is sites in Cloudflare's network also get your real IP through HTTP header. Torrent traffic is not HTTP, so there's no leakage of your IP address to other peers (trackers *do* get your info through HTTP though), and there's this paragraph from [their privacy policy](

>The Application is not designed to hide your identity from the Internet properties you access from your device.
As a result, we may retain your request data when you use WARP™ and WARP+™ for a period of 24 hours for emergency purposes, such as responding to emergency law enforcement requests.

Now, in practice, every time this is [brought up]( at most the concern is Cloudflare being vague and as a large US-based company, they're worthy of a subpoena. Frankly, with the abundance of VPNs that openly state that they don't keep logs and their local law don't require them to give up user data for DMCA lawsuit, some [recommended]( by this very sub, I don't see the reason of risking your chance with Cloudflare facing yet-another lawsuit."
Am I good using Cyberghost for torrenting for the time being?,"Hey I know a lot of you guys say to use Mullvad and that Cyberghost sucks (which to be frank, I'm sure it does). But I bought a month or Cyberghost and don't feel like switching right now. I have cyberghost binded to my torrent client and the kill switch is on. I'm also constantly doing DNS leak tests and torrent leak tests before, during, and after downloading and I've seen no problems yet. So am i good for the time being? I'm probably gonna switch to Mullvad once the month is up but currently, I'm seeing no problems."
Am I good using Cyberghost for torrenting for the time being?,"Cyberghost is part of kape industrys , which was known as crossrider , which literarily got malware named after them.

its also extremely expensive vs what other vpn deliver for the same price or cheaper , and absolutely one of the slower ones in the bunch.

cyberghost was good around 6-8 years ago."

Am I good using Cyberghost for torrenting for the time being?,"I’ve been using it for about a month now and have no complaints, they even have a cool feature named nospy servers. To my understanding those servers are based in Romania, and outside jurisdictions. I’ll probably move to mullvad as it has port forwarding."
Am I good using Cyberghost for torrenting for the time being?,PIAvpn is what I use and it doesn't degrade my torrenting at all.
Am I good using Cyberghost for torrenting for the time being?,"The issue here is, most people who are going to be paying for a VPN, will be using it indefinitely. 
So there needs to be a yearly subscription discount and afaik Mullvad doesn't have those."
Am I good using Cyberghost for torrenting for the time being?,"CyberGhost is enforcing Bitpay for BTC payments.   
Bitpay is requiring full KYC even before you can send any payment. This is gross.  


The fact that CyberGhost is requiring service like Bitpay for crypto payment makes me think.  
CyberGhost is also one of the VPNs that is not being blocked by one of the (questionable) online chats. Combined with Bitpay for crypto is doesn't smells good (honeypot?)."
Awash - A minimal torrent client for home servers & NAS devices - Coming soon!,"&#x200B;



Hello! I'm working on a torrent client for home servers, NAS devices, raspberry PIs, etc, that I plan to release as open source. Why? I switched from QNAP (which had its own client) to TrueNAS, and was disappointed to see that free & open source torrent clients haven't evolved much in the last decade. The web UI, which is essential for server-side clients, is always an afterthought. So I set out to write my own. Note that what you see is a mockup for the front-end and is not final. The back-end API is mostly complete, however I am much less experienced in front-end development so its going to take me a bit longer.

Why not flood? Good question, flood is a very polished web UI that has been developed for years with lots of features. However it is just a web UI, you still have to install a legacy torrent client for it to control. Awash is both a web UI and a torrent client in one, so it will be more minimal on resources. Also I have experience in cross-platform software packaging, so it will be easier to install.

Launch goals:

* Simple, responsive UI
* Easy to install
* Very minimal (should run fine on older raspberry PIs)
* Auto bind to VPN IP if detected

Stretch goals:

* Windows support (everything is cross platform, just will take a bit of extra work & testing)
* RSS feed auto downloader
* Multiple web UI themes
* Full VPN control from the web UI
* What would you like to see?"
Awash - A minimal torrent client for home servers & NAS devices - Coming soon!,"Sweet, always happy to see new open source projects!

I have a few things that would be cool to add, although keeping the project minimal, and supporting features so many major torrent clients don't even support would be pretty difficult. 

Per tracker/catagory ratio rules. Some trackers are ratioless, some are not, it's nice to have control over that aspect so I don't get in trouble with private trackers. 

VPN interface binding. Like qBittorrent, if set, it'll only accept connections from that interface from then on. So if the connection ever drops, you won't be receiving a letter in the mail.

Catagories. If sonarr sends a request to the client it should have its own category, ""series"" or something of the sorts. Then it's placed in ~/downloads/series  etc etc.

Anyway, good luck. Excited to see where the project goes."

There might be a problem with the doileak torrent test.,"I recently made a post asking for info on if my ip was actually leaking. When I do the doileak torrent ip test, my Torrent IPv4 never matches my browsing IPv4. However,  neither of them are my real ip, and they differ by only one or two numbers. 

[Example](

I ran the test on ipleak and torguard, and they both say that they match and I am good. I made this post primarily out of interest to see what is happening here, so if anyone has an answer, it would be much appreciated. 

&#x200B;

For anyone wondering, I am using ExpressVPN and qBittorrent."

Plutonium bo2 torrenting, should I have a vpn for torrenting bo2? or will i be fine without it? (for plutonium)
Plutonium bo2 torrenting,I elaborated the answer to this situation here: 
VPN recommendation to my friend.,Which vpn would you recommend? I'm asking you as I don't know about my friend vpn.
VPN recommendation to my friend.,"Mullvad. Good, speedy, not as expensive

You can pay monthly for the same price as a yearly sub they seem to take privacy seriously."
VPN recommendation to my friend.,"I don't see what the big deal is, why people argue over which is ""best"", just evaluate them for yourself.  I can afford $5 to evaluate a vpn for myself for a month.  I've tried several so far.

I started with Nordvpn, read one of those ""paid reviews"".  It's fast, reliable and stable, but I quickly realized it lacked important features I wanted.  If you want to use wireguard, Nord makes you use their proprietary app, they make it really hard to use open source software to connect, which I use on my router.  They also don't provide port forwarding, for those of you wanting to torrent.

I next tried Mullvad, since most people here recommend them.  Yes, I spent $5 bucks.  That was a week ago.  I'm very happy with them so far.  Mullvad is fast and reliable.  I did lose my wireguard connection yesterday, and resetting didn't bring it back up, I had to switch to a different vpn server, so it hasn't been long enough to decide how reliable they are.  I fired off an email to their tech support, to see if they had an outage, we'll see what they say.

Mullvad offers up to 5 forwarded ports, which is more than most people will ever need.  One for torrent, one for hosting a website, one for hosting a media server, one for hosting remote desktop, one for hosting remote management, what else?  5 is enough for me.

There are other features from Mullvad I wasn't aware of, but really like.  They have 4 different DNS servers you can choose from:  a regular DNS server, an ad blocking dns server, a tracker blocking dns server, and the one I use, an ad blocking + tracker blocking dns server.  It's like a free pihole.  Very cool.

Mullvad also has a connection verify page, which I made my browser home page.  Every time I open a browser window, it checks to make sure my vpn connection is up, and checks for dns leaks and webrtc leaks.  There is also a utility I installed on my linux router, that lets me check my vpn IP address from a shell prompt.  Nice touch they added.

If I wasn't happy with Mullvad, I would probably test another vpn provider, but for now, I'm pretty happy with it.

With Mullvad, my router connects my entire home network via wireguard, and performance is consistently over 400mb/s, maxing out my ISP link.  Doesn't get any better.

Are there other vpn providers that provide the same or even better?  I don't know, maybe, but hard to imagine better.  I'm already getting everything I want.

Hope this helps"
VPN recommendation to my friend.,Mullvad. Done.
VPN recommendation to my friend.,
VPN recommendation to my friend.,The answer is Mullvad.
VPN recommendation to my friend.,I just started using [ivpn.net]( about a month ago. It's somewhat anonymous as they don't have my email address as they have a way to generate account id's without requiring emails. I get their Pro version which is US$10/month.

VPN recommendation to my friend.,"PIA vpn is what I use. Paid for 3 years, came to less than $3.00/month."
VPN recommendation to my friend.,"Is your friend, you? 😋"
VPN recommendation to my friend.,"It might depend on your friend's needs tbh, and the reasons why him/her wants to change a provider. Technical issues, pricing, smth else?

I have tried several before - express VPN, then I chose IPvanish. Both actually worked well - haven't had many issues or smth. Sometimes some servers weren't loading, but that's normal - didn't pay much attention to it. But because of some other reasons decided to try something else. I now use Atlas VPN for quite some time - great services, pretty fast too.And cheap - if that's somehow important to you. Atlas might lack some servers compared to the big VPNs, but they have some great features and it's easy to use. Connection is great and without interruptions and that's a big plus."

VPN recommendation to my friend.,Cyberghost has dedicated torrent servers
Torrent IPv4 doesn’t match my browsing IPv4 when using ExpressVPN,"I have ran the test on doileak multiple times and it keeps returning errors. I have went through the instructions on how to fix the leak with no success. However, I noticed that my torrent IPv4 is only different than my browsing IPv4 by like one or 2 numbers, and neither of them match my real IPv4. Am I all good or is there something I need to fix?"

Is VanwaVPN reliable and safe?,"No , there are more legit VPN which run 10 € per 2 years deals than this lol

i would say Mullvad is the gold standard in cheap and great but if yours money tight there are other VPN which provide cheap and likely good service.

"ExpressVPN and uTorrent Used, Recieved Notification from ISP","Whenever I torrent I use uTorrent and ExpressVPN and yet I got a notification about the activity. Why is this happening. I need to fix this asap.

I'm downloading qBittorrent because I heard good things and has a setting for it to stop activity as soon as the VPN is inactive. Just in case.

Anyone have any advice for me?"
"ExpressVPN and uTorrent Used, Recieved Notification from ISP","Get a different VPN and bind it to qbit so you don't have a leak. Express got bought out and is now generally listed as unreliable/sketchy. Mullvad is 5 euro per month with great security and features. 

Definitely don't use uTorrent ever again.

Don't respond to the warning notice, but definitely be very careful now and always/going forward. They can deactivate your service at any time and the copyright owners can pursue you if they choose, don't make yourself a target.

Oh, and try to get yourself into good quality private trackers to avoid torrents with malicious software or that are uploaded intentionally to bait users into downloading them"
"ExpressVPN and uTorrent Used, Recieved Notification from ISP",Mulvad + qbit (maybe deluge if you are cool)
"ExpressVPN and uTorrent Used, Recieved Notification from ISP","*1 Never have the torrent program start with Windows.

"ExpressVPN and uTorrent Used, Recieved Notification from ISP",What you're referring to is binding Qbit to your VPN. Go to advanced setting and select your VPN for network interface.
"ExpressVPN and uTorrent Used, Recieved Notification from ISP","Some VPN services have leak protection too, so if for some reason the VPN shuts off randomly it will shut off your internet completely."
"ExpressVPN and uTorrent Used, Recieved Notification from ISP","I am using AdguardVPN--considered one of the best--and I too got this notice from my ISP.  I've done some research and--although I haven't yet fixed the situation--from what I understand, the VPN is not ""binded"" to the P2P program.  Since I use Vuze and most of my research has been based specifically on Vuze, I believe I can point you in the right direction.  First--without having ANY torrents uploading or downloading in qBittorrent, go to [www.ipleak.net](  Look at the information you are getting there to see if ExpressVPN is directing you to an IP address that is not your own.  Then, second, scroll down about 1/2 way and look for the ""Torrent Address detection"" link.  Click on ""Activate"", then click on ""Add this magnet link to your torrent client"".  Third, check qBittorrent to make sure the magnet was added and then, fourth, go back to [www.ipleak.net]( and look for the IP Address that is being shown every 10 seconds in the area where you activated ""Torrent Address detection"".  This is where I found that my real IP address was leaking through my VPN.  And as I said, I've been researching it for a while (AdguardVPN basically provided ZERO/NILCH/NADA help).  If your REAL IP  Address was being shown under ""Torrent Address detection"" at [ipleak.net]( then there is a good chance your situation is like mine and that our VPNs are not binded to our torrent clients.  I recommend for your particular situation, you start with this search:

"what is a good vpn , i have around £80 to spend for a 2-3 year plan lmk","I recently switched from nordvpn to mullvad.

1. Mullvad makes it really easy to use both wireguard and openvpn on my custom router.  Nordvpn forces people to use their propriety wireguard app on desktops only.
2. Mullvad will open and forward up to 5 separate ports thru the vpn tunnel, directly to you, so you can host whatever you want.  Nordvpn refuses to, they use the excuse that it's a ""security"" problem.  Most people use the port forwarding for torrent, or host a website, or host a media center to watch content remotely, or host remote desktop access, or host remote management access, etc.
3. Mullvad offers not only regular DNS servers, but also offer specialized DNS servers.  Nordvpn only has one.  With Mullvad, you can select from 4 different DNS servers: normal server, ad-blocking dns server, tracker blocking dns server, or what I use, the tracker+ad blocking dns server.  Basically, this means they offer you pi-hole like dns filtering for free, just use their dns server.  Works great.  I no longer even need my local pi-hole dns server.

DHT doesn't work when using SOCKS5 proxy.,"Hi!

&#x200B;

Since recently my ISP started to block many bt trackers where I seed hundreds of torrents. Now my Deluge client gives me timeout error when trying to announce to those trackers. I have a VPS with Shadowsocks running on it, which I succesfully use for bypassing internet censorship. I want to use this VPS as proxy for announcing to trackers, but I don't need to proxy the actual torrent traffic. I just want to be able to say to tracker that I am online, but use direct connection for seeding/downloading. On my client machine Shadowsocks is running on port 1080, and this is my Deluge proxy settings:

    ""proxy"": {
            ""anonymous_mode"": false,
            ""force_proxy"": false,
            ""hostname"": ""127.0.0.1"",
            ""password"": """",
            ""port"": 1080, // Shadowsocks client
            ""proxy_hostnames"": false,
            ""proxy_peer_connections"": false,
            ""proxy_tracker_connections"": true,
            ""type"": 2,
            ""username"": """"
        },

This works as expected, I can successfully announce to the tracker, the tracker can see me, but there is one problem - DHT stops working completely on all trackers, DHT nodes count is always 0. However, if `proxy_peer_connections` is set to `true`, DHT works fine. But this is not what I want.

&#x200B;

Why is that, and is it possible to use proxy only for connecting to trackers without breaking DHT?"
DHT doesn't work when using SOCKS5 proxy.,"Why though? This all seems like a bad way to go about torrenting. VPS, Shadowsocks and Deluge - you'd be much better off in terms of performance, security and anonymity by using a reputable VPN that supports port-forwarding, which might be what's breaking your DHT once you enable the proxy."
DHT doesn't work when using SOCKS5 proxy.,"Seems like a bad approach, Deluge is well known to have broken proxy support e.g. it is known to leak your real IP when in proxy mode.

The other commenter is correct, a VPN with port forward support is the correct way to go about this. That said if you insist on proxy usage then you should strongly consider switching torrent clients like maybe qBittorrent.

EDIT: TBH I'm not sure how well DHT is expected to work with *any* proxy modes, even qBittorrent has issues with that see   etc."
DHT doesn't work when using SOCKS5 proxy.,"DHT works over UDP, the question becomes:

- Does Shadowsocks support UDP? Apparently yes.
- Does Deluge support UDP over SOCKS5 (UDP associate command): ?

Tixati is one client that can separately define a proxy to use just for trackers."
DHT doesn't work when using SOCKS5 proxy.,"It seems you, guys, are right in that VPN is the only solution for me. As far as I understand, the problem with Shadowsocks is that it doesn't support `X-Forwarded-For` headers, thus it sends not my real IP to trackers, but the IP of my VPS, so I also need to proxy seed connections. I've tried to use plain HTTP-proxy like Squid with `X-Forwarded-For` support, but my ISP can easily detect the real destination by inspecting unencrypted HTTP-headers with something like DPI and block access.

&#x200B;

Why I don't like the VPN approach? Well, my torrent client is always running on my main production machine, and enabling VPN means route the entire traffic of that machine through it, which I don't really want. With Shadowsocks I can use a browser addon like FoxyProxy to route only connections to censored resources via proxy without affecting other traffic. I want to implement something similar in torrent client, but after reading many forums and github issues I started to believe this is impossible."
DHT doesn't work when using SOCKS5 proxy.,"By the way, I've just tried Tor SOCKS5 proxy instead of Shadowsocks, and both DHT and tracker connections work fine while uploads/downloads go directly from/to my real IP(with Deluge settings from the first post). But some trackers seem not to like Tor(permission denied, URL not supported...)."
Can I make my own VPN for torrenting somehow.,"I obviously can keep it hosted on my home network because of iso and DMCA, but I also don't feel the greatest when using a public VPN provider even if they have a no log policy or supposedly use ram for log storage.

Can I make my own VPN for torrenting somehow.,"Ah yes, the monthly DIY VPN question.

If you can the answer is yes. If you should the answer is no. As often mentioned here you lose the benefit of shared IP addresses, multiple servers, security, speed and port-forwarding (unless you also configure it). Plus you'll have your personal data directly tied to your account because VPS aren't designed for anonymity.

Mullvad vpn available in India should credit card is safe to use to purchase it!.,"I think internet is borderless.
You can use any VPN in any country. Unless that country explicitly blocked that VPN provider. In this case there's no reason for India to block the Mullvad. I have used Mullvad from india several times. It works!

Coming to credit card part. Its upto you. If you believe vpn provider will not link credit card info to your random account ID, then go for it. If you don't, purchase a cryptocurrency.
Mullvad process credit card payment through the payment gateway. I think payment gateway company will not share your details with Mullvad, neither Mullvad will ask for it. - Personal opinion

Adding my experience,

I bought Mullvad few months back through PayPal. My primary goal was not torrenting. I did torrented few movies but speeds were not fast, may be server location is too far, that's why.

My advice,
Don't use VPN from India for piracy. Nobody takes piracy seriously here. Unless you plan to seed the latest big banner movie in HDRip format. Emphasize on SEED and LATEST.

If you still afraid, then buy any cheaper VPN based out of India. Because Mullvad is pretty expensive considering indian currency.

Cross border investigations are very costly, hence nobody will run after you unless you are a terrorist!

Still you are afraid, because you do stuff related to terrorism or media activitism. Here's list of best VPNs for India. Choose any tagged with (Safe Jurisdiction)

Bandwidth comparison?,"I have a Gigabit connection and here are my tests.

PIA VPN: Trash application and servers. The download speeds remain consistently slow around 300-400 mbps even on wireguard and the cpu usage magically goes to 100%

Hotspot Shield Vpn: The Max download speeds I was able to get were 380 Mbps. 

Proton VPN: Max download speeds were 500-600 Mbps with huge ping on the closest servers to me. Like 300+

Torguard: Trashy vpn for users in India. Got around 400 Mbps and they have a very limited speeds and set of IP addresses if you aren't in USA. And almost every server in India has 380+ ping. 


Surfshark: almost every Indian server can get me 600+ Mbps.  The other servers almost max out my bandwidth. They give me speeds around 800+ mbps 
I need to use manual configuration for Wireguard since for some reason Wireguard doesn't work for me from their official app.
The other thing that i didn't like about them is that there customer care representatives are noobs. They don't have any technical knowledge per se and will give you set of fixes already mentioned in their website.

Mullvad: Good speed of around 700+ Mbps only on 10gbps servers. 1gbps servers give around 500 mbps speeds. But no server in India. 

Norton VPN: trashy vpn that has speeds till 100 mbps. If your connection has higher bandwidth than that then bad for you. 

Windscribe VPN: poor wireguard speeds and for some reason customer care feels that 300 mbps speed out of a 1000 mbps internet is good while using their vpn. Very expensive except for the build your own plan."

Can I be identified if I use a VPN for torrents and browsing simultaneously?,"Short answer is yes, they could be, but they won’t be.

If you torrent popular pirated content, a media company may be in the seeder pool grabbing IPs of people. Then they try to send notices to ISPs to find, “hey, who was using this IP at this time stamp.” With a VPN, that IP is not tied to you, so the media co is empty handed.

If you also simultaneously logged into websites such as Facebook or a bank, you would create records in their systems including your vpn IP and the timestamp.

Theoretically, someone with access to Facebook/Bank/etc records at the time, as well as the torrenting evidence could link your identity to the torrent. However, this is prohibitively expensive to do in a civil case. They would likely need a team of lawyers, subpoena, etc for every single pirate out there. It’s not worth it for them, they go for the low hanging fruit of people not using VPNs.

Can I be identified if I use a VPN for torrents and browsing simultaneously?,"Deanonymization is easy as hell. Even if they can't link your torrenting to your web sessions immediately, they can get logs from the VPN provider, threatening to hold the VPN responsible if they don't release this information, and see that you were in fact torrenting. And if you think there's no log because the VPN provider told you there's no log, you'd be wrong. They are in fact required to log and keep logs temporarily for ""lawful intercept"" purposes, and if asked by government to monitor you, they may be required to keep logs of your activity indefinitely. I say ""indefinitely"" rather than ""permanently"" because they may be allowed to purge the logs after they hand them off to the government, or after the order is over, etc. And they are required to keep you from knowing you're being monitored, so the common practice is to claim a no-logs policy ""unless required by law"", protected by gag orders.

They will then see:  
\-What trackers you connected to  
\-What peers you connected to  
\-What websites you connected to

What they will not see unless this VPN replaced your root certificate, is the contents of any encrypted connection you make to peers, trackers, or websites. That being said, if you need a proprietary app to connect to the VPN, it's probably replacing your root certificate so it can see your encrypted traffic, likely as part of that ""lawful intercept"" requirement.

That being said, they won't go through such effort, as they already have Facebook, Twitter, and other Big Tech media with cross-site tracking to identify you regardless of your VPN session.

But since torrenting isn't web, if you put your torrent client behind a VPN while browsing without one, you're a lot safer, and you'll just have to hope your VPN provider isn't watching for torrent activity like your ISP may be.

Now if a copyright holder or copyright troll is willing to spend the extra time, and the VPN provider hasn't discarded the logs yet, they could still rat you out, as they'll be asking who connected to X tracker and Y peers at Z time. But if that's who you're up against, the only winning move is to go get a cup of coffee or borrow someone's wifi.

Torrent Configuration NordVPN,"Like can I just open NordVPN, connect to a p2p server and enable the kill switch and that's it?"
Torrent Configuration NordVPN,First problem using Nord as a provider. Some people have reported issues with them before. I believe they have their own subreddit /r/nordvpn.
Torrent Configuration NordVPN,"No, choose a client that supports proper network interface binding and bind it to only ever use the VPN. See pinned posts in sub or read guides pinned to my profile"
SOCKS5,Hello all - I just configured Mullvad and qbittorrent... would folks recommend configuring the proxy server settings in qBittorrent to point to Mullvad's SOCKS5 servers?  I almost feel in a way like things would be more secure if I \*don't\* do this from what I have read up to this point?  What are others' thoughts here?
SOCKS5,Binding qbittorrent to mullvads network adapter is what you want to do. The socks proxy you want to use for your web browser.
SOCKS5,Socks are useless in most cases and in most cases are simply worse than a vpn connection there's close to no benefit.
SOCKS5,"Socks are kinda silly for torrents. That's more for doing shit u don't want to get caught doing like browsing illegal shit or hacking. Mullvad will work just fine alone if you configure it correctly

Edit: I kinda feel you don't know all that much about socks other than there's SOME security to it."
SOCKS5,No need for SOCKS proxy + VPN. You're using qBittorrent so just bind the network interface to your VPN if you want a backup killswitch.
SOCKS5,"Thanks all for your comments...I followed guidance here and bound the interface in qbittorrent to Mullvad based on instructions from [the (now redacted :) guide from Mullvad]( none of it feels super solid to me yet as this is new territory, so thanks for your comments!"
SOCKS5,a proxy doesnt work with port-forwarding. just bind to vpn as suggested
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,"Torrented some stuff while by a friends house half a state away, using Hotspot VPN as well. They have Spectrum and i have AT&T. Some how AT&T is now threatening to revoke our internet ⠀access and fine us. How on earth would they find out, and why would they care if it wasn’t done on their network?"
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,"Man if i think about torrenting and VPN hotspot shield wouldnt come to mind ...

they are US based , their Privacy policy reads unprecise , they also run Partial logs and their privacy policy contradicts themselfs at one point they claim they log the URL you visit on the other hand their VPN doesn log anything of your browsing habbits.

[

&#x200B;

either your VPN leaked or they snitched on you :) because nowhere they claim explicit P2P support also nowhere they claim Explicit non logging."
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,"It's either a shitty VPN or you forgot to

*1 Never have the torrent program start with Windows.

*2 Always have the VPN on before the torrent program

*3 Always turn the torrent program off before the VPN.

*4.Check the Task Manager to be sure the torrent app is
   off before turning off the VPN."
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,I’m thinking it’s the vpn you used. I believe hotspot vpn is a free one on the App Store. So it probably came down too them keeping logs
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,"Are you using the free version of that? Or are you a paid customer of theirs?

According to their site the free version is for web browsing only so I don't see how it would possibly work for torrenting.

If you are their paid customer, & installed a full VPN client on your computer, then contact that VPN provider & verify that they allow torrents/p2p traffic on their network. Also might be worth to ask them what they do in the case of receiving DMCA notices/complaints. It's quite possible they simply forward those to your ISP.

PS - Web browser extensions are not full VPN clients & do nothing for torrenting, unclear if that's one of the mistakes you made here."
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,"The copyright holder checks who is seeding torrents and gets a list of IPs, they get a list of info on the IP (in your case from the VPN company) who then gives them your actual IP, they then inform your ISP who is required by law to inform you of the infringement and to cover their own liability, explain to you that if they keep getting letters they will cut off your service.

My suggestion would be to pick a better VPN and ensure they don't keep logs or pay for content. There are copyright holders who actually do take people to court for this and they pretty much always win. The only time I've ever seen them lose is when it was a porn distributor who was literally the original seeder like a honeypot so they could sue people. Outside of that, pretty open and shut if you get caught and they press it.

EDIT: I guess I didn't make this clear enough. Your phone probably dropped wifi at some point and reverted to the mobile connection. Or it could be the VPN company who sees both your friend's IP address as well as your primary IP address as having connected on your account sent them your IP address because it's the primary one for the device, but the first one is way more likely.

As a side note, ATT will warn you five times, the fifth time making you take a quiz about torrents, and then the sixth time they're legally required to hand over your information to the copyright holders. Cox lost a billion dollar lawsuit over not following this practice. Right now not even the copyright holders know your information, ATT doesn't hand over that information until they're legally required to which legal precedents have set at 6 times."
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,"Are you sure the email is even from your ISP when it could be from someone claiming to be the ISP?

Odds are the alleged ISP isn't looking for an explanation.

You could have malware etc on your device or network that accessed the supposed file. The file may have never even been on your devices at all. Cloud services etc could be present."
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,"Not what you asked, but:

If you get a letter from a lawyer, check if it has any of your contact data. Chances are that the letter was relayed through your ISP and the lawyer migth not know who you are  (unless ofc you reply to the letter, then they know who you are)"

1 So you're already peer to peer. 
2.Connected with AT&T
3 Connected with a friends Spectrum 
4. Connected to a whole VPN
5. May have a virus 
6. Connected to an email service/network
7. Opened a potentially spoofed email (security risk)
8. Maybe used a ""client"" program despite supposedly p2p so now you're connected to all kinds of computers like limewire back in the day. 
9. May be connected in other ways as well. 
10. Probably not sandboxed process, etc 
Don't download strange files. Odds are you are hacked multiple times and maybe getting exploited 


------
Various other thoughts made before the list above:

You mentioned they have Spectrum and you have AT&T but didn't mention what you torrented, (or what you think that means) how are you to know if a certain p2p service had copyrighted material. 

I'm guessing you mean that you are saying you downloaded/borrowed a file from a friend (peer to peer) while on a virtual private network (why they feel a need to call it virtual seems wild considering you have to be connecting to hardware/physical somehow, 2. Private(maybe not so much...) and network (if you're networking to/with someone then its not very private anymore)"
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,It sounds like your vpn wasn't really protecting your privacy while you were online. Your vpn supposed to hide your real Ip address you might have to think about changing vpn. I heard on YouTube that your internet company can fine you if they can see what you are doing online they don't like when you copyright stuff offline you have to have a reliable vpn if you are going to download content offline.
someone please explain how i got a copyright infringement email from my ISP?,"What exactly is AT&T claiming? What part of their terms and conditions do they say you violated? I don't see how anything you do on another network could possibly violate their terms and conditions, and if it does you should get a lawyer to write them a letter explaining how AT&T are not the Internet Police. Even the copyright holder can't fine you, only a court can do that."

My setup,"Im really paranoid about torrenting and want to share my setup with you guys to see if there are any problems with my setup that you might identify.

What I have :

1. Chosen Wireguard in Mullvad
2. Binded VPN with qbittorrent (I have chosen 'Mullvad' in network interface)
3. Always check ipleak and Mullvad check before torrenting
4. Disable dns and webrtc leaks in firefox
5. Always run Mullvad before torrenting client

What I have not:

1. I didnt setup port forwading for Mullvad.

&#x200B;

So is my setup secure? Are there any leaks whatsoever? Binding the vpn with my torrent client would work right? Is there any way I can get torrenting if I setup port forwading with mullvad?"

accidentally started a download without a vpn - possibility ISP will be notified?,"Pretty low I'd assume. It all depends on how often the bot that's tracking IPs on torrents grabs the list of IPs for that torrent. 20 seconds? I'd assume you're safe. it also depends on what the torrent was, how popular it is, and some other stuff too, I'm assuming. 

There's unfortunately no real way to tell though, the above is just my hypothesis."

2. Is seeding safe with a vpn? I heard rumors isps can see if u seed even if u have a vpn but I’m not sure at all
3. What’s the difference between openvpn and the other one called guardwire? Which should I use
4. Other than 1337x where should I find torrents
thank u all 🙏🙏🐸🐸"
stupid baby n0ob questions,"1. Yes
2. Yes
3. Wireguard is newer technology. I recommend using it.
4. If you're using Sonarr, Radarr, etc, for TV shows and Movies, then also use Prowlarr as your multi-indexer. It has lists of other public trackers you can use, or just search here for public trackers. There are also private trackers that may be better suited to your needs."
stupid baby n0ob questions,"As for #2, yes, if they really want to, your ISP is able to discern that you are using the BitTorrent protocol even through a VPN by using highly technical traffic analysis. However, the majority of ISP’s don’t care what you do, as long they don’t hear about it. They only disconnect people after getting numerous violation notices (and some ISP’s plain refuse to issue bans). 

It’s the copyright owners (HBO, Disney, etc) who care about piracy. Those companies hire people to collect IP addresses from torrent swarms and send warnings to the ISP who services that IP. The ISP forwards the notice on to you. 

This is how it typically works in the United States. I’ve read that ISP’s in other countries are forced to do more to prevent piracy."
stupid baby n0ob questions,"1. Yes, but for me it's sort of buggy.
2. Yes.
3. OpenVPN and WireGuard are just clients used to connect to your VPN. WireGuard's setup is much more complicated. I myself prefer OpenVPN's Client.

These are not stupid questions. These are the questions you should be asking while starting out. You're very wise to come to reddit with these questions. Don't call yourself that. Unless you're joking of course!

I can answer number 4 for you, although it's very important that you sort out the other 3 questions I am not the person to answer those for you in depth. I'm sorry.

FOR MEDIA:

My favorite is Rarbg this one is best for movies and TV. Not too many games though. The search can be a little finicky, it's best to search with IMDb's codes.

here's how to get them with IMDb:

Click on the correct link to go to the movie's page (or whatever you're looking for). Be sure you're getting on the correct title page.

The page URL should look like this:

[

where ###### indicates a number.

Copy the 7- or 8-digit ID number that appears & the tt

For example here's the URL of Kill Bill on IMDb:

[

You would search Rarbg for ""tt0266697"" and that would return you all instances on their site.

FOR GAMES: I'd stick with 1337x."

If your question is does 'Just Torrenting Illegal things' reduce your chance of getting caught compared to keeping the torrent seeding, the answer is not really. Your IP will be exposed right when you enter the swarm.

The real question should be does a VPN reduce your chance of getting caught which depends on if you have a reliable paid VPN and if it's set up properly. If that is the case, your chance of getting caught is close to zero from IP leakage or the ISP.

For setting it up, Read the Guides pinned at the top of the subreddit."

Ive been using utorrent & having recently upgraded my NAS have been using utorrent a lot more due to having a lot more disk space available. Decided that it would probably be prudent to pay for a VPN, so did and installed it.. and now the questions!

Once the VPN is active does that automatically apply to everything I do on that Mac? The main reason I ask is that Piratebay website keeps spamming me about using a VPN.. I’m assuming that’s because it doesn’t know or care that I’m using a VPN & is just default spam.. but being ignorant of how these things work I don’t know that for sure! 

Utorrent seems to d/load okay for a while but when left it just seems to grind to almost a halt. This does seem to pretty much happen on films with low seeds/peers - feels like this is pretty normal except that I’d I reboot the Mac all of said film torrents all seem to increase d/load speed for a short while.. is that pretty normal?"
Noob questions,"> Once the VPN is active does that automatically apply to everything I do on that Mac?

I'm not keen on Mac specifics but its the same for any system. Until the connection drops or you try to reconnect manually that's where it gets tricky. Beyond that any app can choose to bypass the VPN unless there are extra checks implemented. qBittorrent is such an app thats why it's mandatory to lock it to the VPN connection in advanced settings."

Yes

>The main reason I ask is that Piratebay website keeps spamming me about using a VPN.

ipleaks.net Geolocation function and torrenting.,"I'm very new to torrenting and using VPNs so sry if the question is just plain dumb.
So before torrenting I made sure to watch out for ""leakage"" so i used :

dnsleaktest : 

ipleak.net : 

but mid torrenting I found the Geolocation function in ipleak (It is said it is based on browser) but it showed my exact real location and now I'm kind of scared.

Should I be wary, did I do something wrong?

Ps: i use qBittorrent and Mullvad (Network interface is already set to Mullvad in qBittorrent and I also enabled the ""Killswitch""."
ipleaks.net Geolocation function and torrenting.,"Geolocation uses different APIs to obtain it, it's not based on the IP address. You can disable that on browser and system level, google it. For instance on macOS it's on the privacy tab inside security settings (disable Location Services)."

NordVPN is now banned here in comments and posts and will get you banned if you talk about it,"Despite everything, Nord and Express are the best overall.  They are both audited regularly, have widespread networks with high speeds, and have good auto-connect features.  Nord does work for changing countries, but cannot compare to the selections available with express.  Express has a strict no logs policy, and all data is encrypted, so a leak isn't very detrimental except for a targeted attack.  But a targeted attack is just as easy on any VPN no?

If a VPN has port forwarding and many regions, but exposes you by having a faulty auto connect, collects and saves logs and doesn't get audited - is it worth the tradeoffs?  Especially considering you can do port forwarding (unless I misunderstand what that means) on qbittorrent anyway."

Update: Spectrum suspended my internet service today,"So I was looking at my account and was going through the claims. They had about 10 individual DMCA notices spanking over the last month. Needless to say I'm shook. I was downloading in mass with an unbound qbit, but using a Killswitch. I've switched to mullvad and have everything bound but I'm still nervous. If I can't rely on a killswich can I rely on binding? In theory they should do the same thing right? I want to keep downloading but these notices are getting out of hand. 



Here's the original thread"
Update: Spectrum suspended my internet service today,"Whatever killswitch you use with your VPN is different from binding. Binding to qBittorrent specifically can't fail, if the VPN connection drops, qBittorrent will stop all activity immediately, it will not have any other network interface to connect to, thus not revealing your real IP to the swarm."
Update: Spectrum suspended my internet service today,Binding is so good I don’t even turn on kill
Update: Spectrum suspended my internet service today,"I never have to worry about that.  I use a router that connects my entire home network to the vpn, so zero chance of leaks, stays up 24/7.

If the vpn connection drops, all Internet stops, no route to Internet (NAT only to vpn tunnel).  Fortunately, my router is very stable, vpn stays up for weeks at a time."
Update: Spectrum suspended my internet service today,"They do not do the same thing. You can bind and be safe without a killswitch, but not the other way around."

Surfshark is completely off the rails!,"An hour ago they posted on the Surfshark subreddit yet again claiming that reports of malware by various antivirus programs are false positives. Interestingly, the number of AV programs, according to that post, have increased significantly over the past few days! They claim to have received ""confirmation"" from the AV companies that these are in fact false positives, BUT they never post any such written confirmation for Surfshark users to evaluate for themselves. I've asked to see something in writing from an AV company stating 'false positive'.....  and got only silence in return. They're not shy claiming 'false positive', why so shy when it comes to showing evidence of that?

The new post goes on to give a link for an updated version of their app. I checked, it's the same version they sent to me 2 or 3 days ago. Defender flagged it just like the earlier ones.

Finally, they persist in offering as a ""fix"" that you should just allow the threat! What the heck kind of fix is that? As I saw someone on twitter say about it, it's like telling you that if you see another car's headlights heading directly for you, just turn your head and you'll be okay."

Surfshark is completely off the rails!,"Looking at the definition that Defender uses, I think it must have to due with bundleware. Surfshark is trying to push their own AV software; it’s possible/likely that they contracted with a disreputable company to re-brand some lousy “security” software as their own. This class of Defender warnings typically applies to those fake anti-malware scareware apps that tell you there are 67,000 problems with your computer, FIX NOW for only $39!!!"

Their free-tier features unlimited bandwidth, without keeping any logs. The free-servers are located in the US, Japan and the Netherlands. The only downside is that those free servers do often get pretty crowded during the day, which will everything a bit slower, but it works on mobile too.

If you want to circumvent censorship, Tor would usually be your best choice, but since it isn't a VPN, it's difficult to use it with apps, and it's often times even slower, due to the traffic being routed through several gateways."

Your service provider passes the message to you. When I got my message from the copyright lawyers I ACTUALLY called them to find out what the hell they were wanting from me. I learned a lot from talking with the copyright lawyers.

1- Don't admit to downloading anything. They already know your computer location & how long it takes for you to download stuff so saying it wasn't you won't work but the lawyers have no idea if your in a apartment building or neighborhood & one of your neighbors might be stealing your wifi or a roommate is using your computer.

2-The most important thing is to NOT PAY THEM ANYTHING. The lawyers will say that the fines for what you downloaded or what they caught you downloading might be $200 each file or maybe they can work a deal with you where you pay $1000 or so for all the files they found you downloaded. This is a TRICK because you can only pay them by credit card & if you pay ANYTHING they will cancel the charge get you ACTUAL info from the credit card(your ip address is not a person  so they can't use that to find you) and once you pay they cancel & get your real info, they WILL sue you in court or in a class action with other torrent downloaders since making a payment for the fine of the illegal files you downloaded is proof your guilty. If you didn't download the files why would you pay the fine thats how the lawyers think.

I would stop downloading torrents & find people that have the files you want on there cloud drives & are willing to share. That way your not at fault for downloading anything since it's not your cloud drive.

I hope this info helps everybody."
Spectrum Notice,Ok after careful research and consideration I'm now using both fastest VPN and Windscribe. I've bound Windscribe to qbittorrent and have gone through the various setup steps to ensure my IP won't be leaked. Wish me luck
Spectrum Notice,"No matter what you think your VPN is doing, guys like me can enable DPI, take your traffic apart, sniff it...put it back together, reapply a cert and send it off....and, it is not illegal (you did sign the EULA, right?). 

Even if Spectrum is not running DPI (and I doubt they are), they can see where your traffic is going and what the contents are...and know where it is from and assume what it is.

There is this thing called ""honesty"" - maybe smore folks should try it."

Proof of Credit Rewards & Lifetime VPN,"**Proof of Credit Rewards & Lifetime Decentralized VPN**

You can find discount codes / links for 5% below in a differnt post or just pm me - (links are directly to there store)

It's VERY important to learn what DPN's are ( decentralized VPNs ) and do a proper amount of research regarding the Deeper Network. ( as in NFA + DYOR)

I've summed up the best of and listed them below . This higlights my opinion and facts about them. This is just an opinion, not advice in any shape or form.

* Helium Networtk Partnership - They have an OFFICIAL partnership with the Helium Network and you can actually purchase a DPN miner/VPN WITH an HNT miner for 299$. You can find the link below -with a 5% discount-
* One time purchase Lifetime VPN. No subscription.
* WORKING PRODUCT - Yes, your crypto project is spaculating(sarcasm no offence), they've got more than 54.000 nodes worldwide and multiple working products with actual use.
* Proof of Credit Rewards/Staking Rewards (Up to 60% APY)
* CEO/Co-Founder Russel Liu - Worked as Head of Research in Palo Alto Networks (Cybersecurity Company) - Stressing out the part of CYBERSECURITY.
* Plug'n'Play installation
* Decentralized vs Centralized Services. There are two layers in the deeper chain. The top layer consists of hundreds of validator nodes and is secured by credit scores of deeper devices; the more people involved in bandwidth sharing, the more secure the network will be. The bottom layer is called the deeper layer, and it consists of peer-to-peer connected Deeper devices. These devices earn token rewards by sharing their bandwidth with each other.
* Trident Protocol : A decentralized, shared communications protocol based on the blockchain. It circumvents network censorship, secures data transmissions, maximizes the use of network bandwidth, and reduces delays in the data packet transmission process. This is achieved thanks to the efficient integration of network technologies such as intranet penetration, data encryption, protocol camouflage, and tunnel layer congestion control.
* Torrents - You can Toggle on OR off the torrent usage of your device. If you don't want to allow any form of torrent download or upload, you can just adjust it from the AtomOS interface.
* DPN - aka Decentralized VPN & Proof of Credit - Essentially you are getting rewarded by using someone elses bandwidth and vice versa. You are getting rewarde 1 credit score for 100mbs of use or 1 credit score for 10mbs of allowed bandwidth (shared data)
* What if you DON'T want to allow your device to share data/ allow other people to use your extra bandwidth ? That's pretty darn easy. YOU CAN TURN IT OFF with a click from AtomOS. And you can still get rewarded for 1 point of credit (used for staking rewards) when you are using someone elses bandwidth - aka using the dpn/deeper node network - It's 1 credit score per 100mb of use that you get every 2 days.
* You can disable ALL YouTube ads. Yes, with a click. At this stage, you're just having a black screen, but at a later stage you will be rewarded for the time spent watching those ads. So you can let it on and get rewarded for your time.
* You have LOGS. Now i know people are being paranoid, and again that's me and my POV. On your AtomOS interface, you have logs on whoever used your device. They have parts blocked, so they're not condemning, but can cleary show it was not YOU performing any sort of bad behaviour. Authorities ain;t dumb and can confirm that. Plus, you ALSO have a community made blacklist of sites that you can just simply upload and have as a filter. And again, you can simply turn that off.
* You can actually blacklist any site that you don't want to allow access to.

And if that was not enough for you, you can simply ask away. Thanks for reading ;)

MacOS + OpenVPN/Tunnelblick + Qbittorrent split tunnel question,"This is a followup to a post last week since I am continuing to get stuck.

I am trying to setup my VPN configuration on my Mac so that *only* my torrent traffic goes through the VPN and everything else bypasses the VPN and goes out to the internet directly. 

I have installed Tunnelblick with the openvpn config obtained from my VPN provider. When I connect to the VPN, it forces all traffic through the VPN including BitTorrent. (I have qbit bound to the VPN network interface.) This behavior persists even when I have unchecked ""Route all IPv4 traffic through the VPN"" in the Tunnelblick settings. 

I then tried creating a new version of my VPN config with the ""route-nopull"" option, and then the ""pull-filter ignore redirect-gateway"" option added in, based on ideas I found via a google search. With both of these options, it appeared that *no* traffic at all was being routed through the VPN, including torrent traffic. Qbit showed no activity at all when I was logged into the VPN like this. (Like before, Qbit was bound to the VPN network interface.)

I am looking for a configuration approach that will allow me to selectively direct only Torrent traffic to the VPN and nothing else. I've seen many solutions that allow you to filter traffic in/out of the VPN based on the IP address but I don't think that will work in this case. (If I'm wrong, please educate me!) I could filter the traffic based on any of the following:

* The application (qbittorrent)
* The port number (Qbit uses a unique port that isn't used by any other processes on the computer)
* Some other solution that accomplishes what I tried above with the route-nopull and the pull-filter options, i.e. having the VPN connection open and allowing Qbit to bind to it and direct its traffic through that connection, but otherwise having all traffic bypass the VPN. 

Thanks!"
MacOS + OpenVPN/Tunnelblick + Qbittorrent split tunnel question,"You can specify a network interface in qBittorent, so you can specify the VPN interface to force it to use the VPN. Seems like you already know about that and it only solves half the problem, but thought I'd mention it. Look up ""split tunneling"" for OpenVPN. I think that's what you're after. Another option would be a docker container or a virtual machine. Set up a docker container with qBittorrent and openVPN installed. Then you don't need to do anything on your host."

Route qbittorrent to vpn interface only?,"Well, I have been researching how to route torrenting traffic to vpn interface only.

I am using wireguard for vpn, and have qbittorrent bind on it. The thing is, if I set

>AllowedIPs = [0.0.0.0/1]( [128.0.0.0/1]( ::/1, 8000::/1

Then I will have all my traffic route through the wireguard interface. Because longest match subnet, then [0.0.0.0/1]( and 128.0.0.1/1 would have priority over original 0.0.0.0/0.

If I didn't set allowedips, then wireguard won't even create connection to remote vpn server.

Thus, I test manually set [0.0.0.0]( mask [0.0.0.0]( gateway vpnip and metric highly than my ISP gateway to get my normal traffic through ISP. But then qbit doesn't have connection ability through wireguard even though it is binded to wireguard interface.

Its kinda slow using vpn for all the traffic, so is there any way I can have my original traffic (eg. YT, spotify) through my ISP and vpn for torrenting?  


Edit: The metric method works in the end. Problem is need to use   


>AllowedIPs = [0.0.0.0/0](  


But I don't want to use kill-switch. After googling, I found this works   
[  


so you need to set Table = off to avoid auto trigger kill-switch, and my qbit works fine in vpn and yt in isp right now!

Route qbittorrent to vpn interface only?,It's a steep learning curve but I installed pfsense.
Route qbittorrent to vpn interface only?,"AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0

After that's added to the routing list (cmd: `route print`), the ISP and VPN connection will have equal priorities for routing traffic. The next step is semi manual, you need to force all regular traffic through LAN:

    route add 0.0.0.0 mask 128.0.0.0 <router IP> if 32
    route add 128.0.0.0 mask 128.0.0.0 <router IP> if 32
    route add ::/1 <link-local computer ip> if 32
    route add 8000::/1 <link-local computer ip> if 32

ipconfig /all shows this:

> Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::1234:5678:9abc:def%32(Preferred)

Then your IPv6 lines will be:

route add ::/1 fe80::1234:5678:9abc:def if 32

The same interface number to be applied to other lines too (you can see interfaces at the top of `route print`)

You can delete 0.0.0.0 BEFORE starting a VPN, for a cleaner routing table.

After all that's done, you've practically an inverted version of how VPN connections add themselves: ISP first, VPN second choice.

From now on you can only force connections to run through VPN with the network binding in client settings."
issues concering low upload speeds with mullvad and qbittorent,I have an issue regarding my upload speeds consistantly below 1mibps when they should really be much higher.

parents found out about me torrenting and are upset. How do I explain it’s not a big deal?,"Basically i’ve been downloading music and movies from soulseek as well as 1337x for the better part of a year now of course always using a vpn that is configured properly. The other day my dad asked my what I was doing while I was downloading some new albums, I explained to him and he disapproved of it even after I explained it extensively. After he explained it to my mom they both had a long and serious conversation with me about how this could land them in jail and how I was jeopardizing our entire family along with everything they’ve worked for.  They told me I need to remove all the music and movies off of my computer and never do it again. I can definitely understand what their approach to all this is but it seems a tad extreme especially the jail part. My configuration for downloading things is surfshark vpn that is directly routed to qbittorrent. I always triple check that I have 0 ip leaks of any kind and only download torrents from trusted sites. How can I convince them that this is not such an extreme issue and is relatively safe. Any links to articles or some form of a trusted source that I can show to them would be greatly appreciated."

That is a hilarious reaction. Just make sure you bind your VPN to qBittorrent. People are usually afraid of things they don't understand. It's piracy after all, I doubt there's any convincing them, no matter what you show or tell them. If they don't have access to your computer, just lie and tell them you stopped doing it, and don't tell your parents anything about torrenting again."
parents found out about me torrenting and are upset. How do I explain it’s not a big deal?,"Your parents probably remember the headlines about kids getting sued for millions of dollars for downloading songs off limewire. This was a couple decades ago when the recording and movie industry was first cracking down on file sharing.

It turns out suing kids for millions of dollars is terrible PR so they don't really do that anymore. These days the worst that would happen, if you didn't have a VPN, is that you would get a letter from your ISP warning you to stop.

Just never mention anything about this again and carry on. Keep what you do on the VPN to yourself 😂"

The power of propaganda.

Just to reaffirm you: this wont do anything. It's already local

You can't convince them. They're in the territory of infallible **religious beliefs** on that topic. You'd need someone they consider an authority, like an IT uncle from your relatives.

What can you do? Create an encrypted virtual machine and continue there if you want.

1. Veracrypt, create encrypted file container. You need it as big as the OS + file you want to store inside. At least 100 gig

2. VirtualBox. It's a free virtualization software. Install, create new, choose a location inside the veracrypt container (once thats unlocked and loaded)

3. Windows or Linux ISO to install a new system inside. You can get an official ISO from Microsoft, no key needed. If you never enter a key, the only downside is the ""unregistered"" overlay on the bottom right

4. VPN and Bittorrent inside that system. To transfer files to your main system, you can enable Clipboard / Drag-and-Drop / a shared folder.

See guides online if interested."
parents found out about me torrenting and are upset. How do I explain it’s not a big deal?,"Ask yourself what is more important, a good relationship to your parents or your torrenting habits. If it is the first, comply at least by stopping the habit and putting all your ""treasures"" on veracrypt. You deleted the files from the ""open"" harddrive then and essentially did what was asked.   
Ask them to get you a Spotify + Netflix streaming account or something similar - you can pay them back in the future if they do not want to pay for you. Just open a tab and pay once you have a job.    


With one ""fee"" for illegal downloads of 800 USD you can pay for 80 months of Spotify and 40 months of Spotify and Netflix. It is realistic to never assume you are safe online. You can consider the incident a sign to change your habits.

And yet, when I start a new torrent (or restart one I've paused) my network traffic almost stops. I can't get above 30kb transfer speeds either torrenting or normal web traffic. As soon as I pause or stop any active torrents, after a couple of mins my network traffic is back to normal full speed.

Is there something I'm missing here? Mullvad don't throttle so it must be my ISP. And since Mullvad encrypt everything how can my ISP know what type of data I'm downloading?

What did I do wrong?,"I recently got a email from my ISP after torrenting and I do not know why. I bought a new VPN recently because my old one didn't work for me at school. I used to torrent things with my old VPN and set it up properly and after the first time (when I didn't know what I was doing) I never got another one. I set up the new one exactly the same as the old one but somehow it didn't work. I set the torreting program to only use the VPN network, and I set the VPN app to killswitch just in case. I turned on the VPN to make sure it was working and used multiple IP checks and torrent ip check and all was good. So I want to know why this happened so I can prevent it in the future.

What I think it might be:

* The original VPN was Mullvad and now I'm using NordVPN (because it works for school)
* Mullvad had proxies and so does Nord but I didn't think it would be nessacary because I dont remember using it on Mullvad.
* I used a server that was within 10 miles of me because I wanted the fastest download I could get

[BENCHMARK][VIDEO] Torrenting with and without Port-Forwarding,"Benchmark video (sped up 8x):  

* Top: Port-forwarding enabled.
* Bottom: No port-forwarding.
* Test conducted in the same 10m span, same torrent, same server and same VPN. **Only port is different**.

I think this clearly illustrates the impact of having port-forwarding enabled and why using VPNs that don't support it (like NordVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN and so on) just cannot provide the same level of performance.

---

What is port-forwarding? From [List of Recommended VPNs (2022)](

> **Port-forwarding significantly increases the amount of seeders/peers you connect to, which influences the download and upload speed performance (and ratio). It is especially useful for seeding and torrents without too many seeders/peers.**

To be fair the test was also done for a torrent where the port-forwarding impact is especially noticeable (few seeders). For users who do hit-and-runs of popular torrents (+100 seeders) or at private trackers, since there'll always be some seedboxes or port-forwarded users then obviously it won't make as much difference as here.

TLDR: Get a VPN with port-forwarding unless you only download popular torrents and don't seed."

I only need the VPN for torrenting, not for any other tasks, and I definitely don’t want my Plex Server traffic routed through the VPN because it impacts connectivity.

*Server:* I have an 2007 MacBook Pro that serves as my Plex Server machine (always on, Ethernet connection to network).

*Primary computer:* I have another MacBook Pro that serves as my primary laptop (almost always on, wi-fi connection to network). I have my VPN client installed on this machine, and when I need to download a torrent, I connect to the VPN from that machine. (Qbittorrent with binding to the VPN connection.)

I’d ideally like to figure out a way to achieve some sort of split tunneling, where I can have a single machine running the Plex Server, the torrent client, and with file sharing accessible to MacOS machines on the local network, and *only* the torrent traffic is fed through the VPN, everything else is direct. 

Is it possible to do this on a MacBook Pro (running MacOS 10.11.6 El Capitan, nothing newer)?

An alternative approach that would be a little more complicated for me is, I have a Raspberry Pi 4 that I’d be willing to try setting up to accomplish all of the above, but I’d need some assistance in identifying the right steps .

Another alternative that I’d consider would be some sort of virtual machine running the VPN client and the Torrent client, which would be able to share storage with the computer it’s running on, which would handle file server and plex server tasks outside of the virtual machine.

Wise geniuses of Reddit, what advice do you have for me?"
MacOS + VPN + Torrent + Plex setup,"Tunnelblick with OpenVPN configurations, or docker container."
MacOS + VPN + Torrent + Plex setup,You have identified everything correctly. Why would the Raspberry Pi be any different? There're probably more tutorials out there than active people here. Connect to a monitor and repeat the same steps.
TCP doesn't work with torrenting... Only UDP works with very slow speeds (Help)," When I connect to a p2p server using  Nordvpn, downloads will go  fine for a while, as well as internet traffic  on the PC in general.  After a few minutes the speed just drops to  nothing and internet connection is gone. Odd thing is, Nord sees me as  connected. So my connection with nord and server looks fine, but the  internet is gone. I am using p2p servers. Tried bunch of them.

I  uninstalled, deleted NordVPN and reinstalled it again, that didn't  work. I disabled IPV6 and used NordVPN's own DNS . NordLynx selected in  qbittorrent too. Checked firewall settings etc.

Only thing that  works is just selecting UDP protocol in Qbittorent. Without nord, both  TCP and UDP is fine. But for some reason I can't use TCP in torrent with Nord.  Sometimes in 5-10 minutes, sometimes in like 30 minutes it just kills  the whole internet completely.

Tried bunch of things while googling the problem, including some methods suggested on reddit, but no luck.

I have to disable killswitch and disconnect from Nord to get back on internet.

The  issue here is UDP. Its too slow. Seeder counts doesn't matter, peers  doesnt matter, all i can get is less than quarter of my total internet  bandwith (in qbittorent). I haven't enabled or set any limits to my  connection or speed.

What is the problem here ? Why is TCP causing this ?"
TCP doesn't work with torrenting... Only UDP works with very slow speeds (Help),"/r/nordvpn

But TCP/μTP on qB shouldn't have an impact, it's just the peer connection protocol. As for speed issues, NordVPN is one of the worst VPNs out there for torrenting due to the lack of port-forwarding, which is why most users here aren't NordVPN users.



[If you want to become informed: List of Recommended VPNs (2022)]("
TCP doesn't work with torrenting... Only UDP works with very slow speeds (Help),Nord has been giving me the same problem for a while now was fine last year. My internet will just stop after it sees high usage from P2P. only way to get it back is to DC Nord and rejoin. I think they have made changes to reduce p2p for this buyout or buyup of another company but just my way of thinking. I plan to move in may to another VPN.  Thinking Mullvad but not sure still doing R&D since I need port forwarding due to change in internet provider not allowing Port warding.
Vpn not letting me access Torrent sites,As the title suggest I can't go onto torrent sites I get a 403 or I can  go onto them but not access the downloads. However I noticed that when I  go and turn off my vpn (ipvanish) I can access the sites just fine. Anyone know  what's happening?

"Besides binding qbit to PIA, and opening a port, what other setting changes might be beneficial?","I have heard that changing the protocol to tcp only is beneficial, as well as only allowing ipv4 connections, and ensuring that the open port is between 50-60k (mine is currently between 30-40k). I am using wireguard, built in PIA DNS, and have my killswitch enabled if that helps."
"Besides binding qbit to PIA, and opening a port, what other setting changes might be beneficial?","changing protocol to tcp is usually not needed, as it can slow your speed and udp is secure enough (wireguard only use UDP)"

Mullvad VPN 2022 REVIEW: A Great VPN service that provides security and affordability,"Thanks for your review, this VPN should be what everyone uses rather than the ""Big Name VPNs"" but as long as those guys keep paying the reviewers to shill their service they will always suckered new people in.

Ive used mullvad for 3 monts or so and it is hands down the best VPN out there. It hits all the marks a VPN should - Multiple external Audits proving they don't log, it's fast, it has port forwarding, it's completely anonymous (don't even need to create a login, it generates a 16 digit numerical line and you just type that in to login. You can even pay by sending them actual cash) plus it's open source. There's no reason not to use it compared to"

Mullvad VPN 2022 REVIEW: A Great VPN service that provides security and affordability,"My review is simply based on my experience with Mullvad’s service and the information from their website. They do not compensate reviewers. This was completely independently done, I’ve had a lot of bad luck with VPNs in the past and have noticed that a lot of reviews seem to be based on the services that payout the most in affiliate fees. This review - and any others that we put out - do not have any affiliate links included. Just links back to information on the provider’s website or other informational sources. I found Mullvad when I was on vacation about a month ago and decided to give their service a try because finding a VPN that I felt like I could trust was a pain in the ass. I still have some other VPNs to test and report on, but so far, Mullvad’s service has been consistent and secure for me. I was hoping my independent reviews of VPN services would end up helping someone trying to make informed decisions.

Again, not a paid review, just sick of seeing all the bullshit affiliate paid reviews."

"Noob question about torrenting, plex, and port forwarding","Background: I setup my vpn's (mullvad) port forwarding, added the port to plex, added a firewall rule to windows to allow the port connection, and ran ""netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=xxxxx listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=32400 connectaddress=127.0.0.1"" in cmd per mullvad's [instructions](

Question: Can I use this same port to download torrents that I use for plex, or does it put me at risk?"
"Noob question about torrenting, plex, and port forwarding",Use a different port.
"Noob question about torrenting, plex, and port forwarding",you must use a different port because only one program can use a port number at a time (simplified)
"Unbinded torrent client from VPN, torrents started working again","I’ve been having trouble with trying to torrent for a bit now. It would always stay at 0%. Yes there were seeds, before anyone asks that.

I had recently binded my client (qbit) to my VPN (Mullvad) and that worked fine for a bit. But then torrents just would not download. I updated Mullvad, I uninstalled and reinstalled qbittorrent, I forwarded the ports (as much as that pained me to do as a non-tech geek). And still nothing worked. So finally I decided to unbind my client, and finally torrents started to download.

So what happened here? What did I do wrong?"
"Unbinded torrent client from VPN, torrents started working again",Did you run an ip leak detector to see if your torrents are traceable to your actual IP?
"Unbinded torrent client from VPN, torrents started working again",Mullvad doesn't work for me when bound either. Went back to PIA. Not safe to run unbound.
"Unbinded torrent client from VPN, torrents started working again","You may have to rebind every now and then, especially on macOS where the utun interface changes on quick reconnects/reboots. But this is safe, no worries."
"Unbinded torrent client from VPN, torrents started working again",Just make sure that you bind the Mullvad network adapter and not the specific ip address settings because ip addresses can change but Mullvad should use the same network adapter unless you change protocols from OpenVPN to wiregaurd for example. Hopefully that works.
Bypassing Watchguard Firewall,"My question is how do I bypass this firewall?

So my college campus and dorm uses a firewall called Watchguard, and they block all websites that aren't educational websites.

So far a workaround for me on my iPhone is connecting to IKEv2 first outside college buildings, then once I'm inside I connect to WiFi (since the connection inside buildings is not strong enough to just connect through there). The problem with this is this method is it does not work on my MacBook, which I do the majority of my web surfing / casual indie gaming. My classmates have mentioned using ""Windscribe"", ""PsiphonVPN"", and ""Hide Me VPN"".

On my MacBook a software that works is X-VPN. There are three problems with X-VPN: it's slow, pricey, and unreliable (inconsistent speeds and only a select few servers work to bypass the firewall).

So far I've tried Surfshark on my Mac to no avail, Mullvad (Wireguard, OpenVPN (w or w/o bridge mode)), and haven't tried finding other solutions on iPhone since Surfshark works well and am already subscribed to a 2 year deal prior to getting into college.

What other alternatives can I try? I'm open to all ideas and am willing to learn more networking stuff, but I don't know where to look

Thanks for your time!"
Bypassing Watchguard Firewall,">  The problem with this is this method is it does not work on my MacBook

You can let the macbook use your phone's connection. USB or Bluetooth tethering.

AirVPN provides tunneling over SSH or stunnel to bypass blocks like these. I won't be able to assist you, although I see they've got guides: ""Using AirVPN with SSH Tunnel"" and ""Using AirVPN with SSL Tunnel"""
Mullvad really is incredible,"I finally bit the bullet and tried Mullvad out.  

I'm sold.  It checks every single box, and then boxes I didn't even have on my checklist.  The ease of use, privacy, reliability, UI, pricing model, and overall just quality of the service and product is out of this world. I've tried quite a few VPNs including AirVPN, Cyberghost, Nord, and a few others...  It's a little more pricey than some other products out there, but it blows them out of the water.  This is something you're using on your computer every day.  Get the best that there is for the job that you want it to do.  It's 5 fucking bucks a month!  Am I really going to miss a couple extra dollars over the course of a few years when I piss away money on steam games and booze and whatever the else the fuck I carelessly buy? Not that I'm horrible with money, I'm actually quite a bit of an invester. But Mullvad is so fucking worth it.

I just received a letter from my ISP,"So I was caught even though I was using a VPN (Proton VPN). The letter from the copyright holder told me to delete all the content that I've downloaded and send them a reply telling them that I did it. When I looked online it was recommend to just keep it quiet and it's just a warning. My ISP also said in the email they didnt send any information (unless they get a letter from the judge). Is that the best approach? 

In the notice it also clearly said that I was using bittorrent. I'm not quite sure what happened. Did my VPN drop or something? Or what could've happened? When my connection drops on the VPN the twitch streams that I watch usually lags out. And it did not happen when I was downloading that show.

While I dont mind getting Netflix & Prime. I just cant sub to 1 billion different streaming services. And some things straight up cant be watch online or arent reasonably priced. Can I not torrent anymore since I'm probably on some kind of list now and next warning I can probably get sued? Should I delete everything I have? Can they see that I'm using plex.

Sorry I have many questions. Little stressed, I dont want to get sued or have to pay an insane amount."
I just received a letter from my ISP,"You’re fine, they won’t pursue it with legal action or fines, don’t stress out. The VPN connection likely dropped for a bit and the copyright trolls reported you. 

If you want to keep torrenting, bind your vpn connection to your torrent client (in qbittorrent, go to settings -> advanced-> network interface -> select the vpn connection, apply and restart qbittorrent).  

If you’re fine with paying for a service or two to get almost whatever content you want, you could buy a monthly sub to a reputable seller in r/plexshares or you could use a seedbox to torrent on the company’s servers and directly download it completely safe (r/seedboxes)."
I just received a letter from my ISP,You probably don't have your torrent client bound to the VPN adapter. That will solve the problem. No need to delete anything or respond to the letter in any way. Plex is not a violation of anything.
I just received a letter from my ISP,"Note: ProtonVPN's free plan doesn't support Torrenting. So, when you're torrenting, you need another VPN.

If you can afford it, Mullvad is said to be the best one now. And do what others wrote in comments about binding it to your download client.

That way, no traffic will be transferred when the VPN isn't working."

By saying yes to their request, you legally admit you had done it. Further proceeding depends on your country.

> My ISP also said in the email they didnt send any information (unless they get a letter from the judge).

Are you sure support knows about this? I doubt.

You've fallen victim to false advertising and shitty VPN software. I don't see anywhere in your post that you've bound the client to the VPN connection.

Yet by doing so you indirectly pay the copyright holders who lobby for worse laws that enable trolls like the one who found you. *You're loading a revolver that's pointing at you with bullets*"
VPN still leaking IP?,"Hello, new to torrenting, am using NordVPN while downloading movies for PleX, and I have noticed that if I use iknowwhatyoudownload.com with my actual IP address, I am seeing several different movies that I downloaded.  Its only 4 out of the \~31 separate things I downloaded, but it is still showing up, which scares me off wanting to continue, so I have stopped for now.

Again, I was using NordVPN, and I set up the kill switch, told it to auto quit qbittorrent if it disconnected, and I went into the torrent settings and linked the network adapter.  I thought all of that would be enough, but clearly it wasn't, or I did something wrong.  I even checked that the IP had changed, and I used a few websites I found on this subreddit to test if anything else was leaking (which returned negative).

Im assuming that if a random website was able to track my IP around, then my ISP/copy right holders probably have the same info if not more, and I should expect a warning letter or something?"
VPN still leaking IP?,"""Linked the network adapter"" doesn't sound exactly like you bound correctly. Can you describe exactly which setting you changed and what you picked?"

Best practices for Torrenting,"Hello,

I was wondering if there is something like a list of ""Best Practices"" when torrenting.

I know about ""always turn on the torrent client after the vpn"" and ""always turn of the client before the vpn"" and stuff, but is that still even necessary if I binded qBittorrent to my VPN?

Is there other security-relevant practices to live by?"
Best practices for Torrenting,"If you have qbt binded correctly it's better than any Killswitch. Make sure you trust your VPN provider. Seed as much as you can.

PIA Questions,"So I’m new to torrenting in fact I haven’t done it at all, Im aware of the basic steps and precautions like Binding the VPN network interface to the torrent client but I have a couple of questions, 

1. my average download speed is around 100-120mbps, while using the wire guard protocol I receive around 60-70mbps,  does my device effect the results? I think heard something about your devices processor affecting the speed. 

2. Is it ever safe to turn your vpn off After finishing a torrent process. 

3. Is port forwarding necessary, I saw a post explaining how to bind the vpn network interface to the torrent client but I didn’t see anything about port forwarding which is what I thought it’s whole purpose was for, is it just a simpler way to help bind it?

I’m also planning on using qbittorrent, I appreciated answers to any of the questions thank u."
PIA Questions,"You'll get people telling you port forwarding is not necessary. For me, it doesn't work without it. YMMV. There's no good reason NOT to do it, but you do have to keep up with changing it in  the client, etc. when the port changes in the PIA client.

Speed is slower than your normal internet speed just because it's going through so many additional steps to get to you.

Never have your torrent client open and the VPN off. Never.

Bind, bind, bind...do not skip ....BIND."
PIA Questions,"Pf is for finding peers, without which you’ll have several problems relating to speed."
PIA Questions,"I never turn off the vpn, no need, I have a fast router that easily encrypts all LAN traffic to the vpn at wirespeed (I have 200mb/s pipe to Internet).  My router easily fills the pipe, the cpu hits around 30% utilization during full speed tests.

Don't use a cheapo store bought router.  They are way too slow.  Spend $200 get a fast mini-pc with 2 gigabit ethernet ports, and install pfSense (does about 100mb/s) or better yet VyOS (much faster) if you are comfortable with command line tools."
PIA Questions,I turn off my VPN whenever I finish torrenting. Just double check that you have exited Qbitorrent completely. Make sure you Bind Qbitorrent to VPN. You said you haven't started torrenting. Test your Bind/VPN: 1)Turn off PIA 2) download ubuntu torrent it's free and legal. >> [ <<. 3) It should not download if bind correctly. 4) Turn on PIA. 5) Downloading should start.
PIA Questions,"> 60-70mbps

1. You should expect a 3-10% loss give or take. maybe its your CPU, maybe its their server or anything in between.

2. yes if bound / yes if the process is gone. though if you can stay to seed (WITH BINDING)

3. see my profile for guides"

Dynamic port forwarding vs static,"Can somebody explain to me the difference?  I am looking to switch from Cyberghost as my VPN so I can use Port Forwarding with Private Trackers.  

So I know when I port forward without a VPN I set a static IP address to my machine and choose a port.  ([192.168.1.139]( for example, and Port 12456). I then configure these in my router, in windows on my network adapter, and then on my torrent client.  Bam, my ports are forwarded.  

How do I forward my ports on a VPN?  Something tells me that if port forwarding is dynamic that things won't be as simple because either my IP address or port is regularly  going to change and create issues.  Should I be looking for a VPN that offers static port forwarding? 

Thank you for taking the time to read my post and offer a reply."
Dynamic port forwarding vs static,"I'd prefer a static port. Mullvad offers it, but you don't have the choice in which port is opening for your connection on their server. 

So you just get the port, configure your torrent clients listening port to use that port that they assigned to you, then you should be set. 

A dynamic port would suck because it could change each time you establish the connection, meaning if the connection drops for whatever reason, your VPN provider may assign you a different dynamic port, which would force you to change your torrent clients listening port to whatever port they assigned you. 

Although, this varies depending on what service you're using. Using mullvad I've not had much issue, but I'd be sure to research the provider you're interested in, and how they handle port forwarding.

Some providers let you choose which port to open, some don't, some are dynamic, some are static, and some don't support port forwarding at all.



Edit:

You do not need to port forward from your local router when using a VPN. The VPN providers servers will handle port forwarding."
Dynamic port forwarding vs static,"> How do I forward my ports on a VPN?

Each VPN service handles port forwarding differently so they'd each have their own instructions on how to do this.

> Should I be looking for a VPN that offers static port forwarding?

Your main objective is to make sure the VPN service offers port forwarding, period. Most VPN services do not offer that option.

I'm not really sure that static vs dynamic really applies here. The main differences that you'll see is in *how* the port forward gets created

* Port forward configured via UPNP
* Port forward configured via VPN client provided by the VPN service
* Port forward configured via the VPN service's website

IMO UPNP is the least effective, sometimes it works & sometimes it doesn't. UPNP is more reliable when used in combination with a installed VPN client.

Using the VPN client for the port forward can be good or bad, depends on whether you want to install a client & whether the VPN client software itself is any good.

Using the VPN service's website is the most reliable IMO & also allows you advanced usage e.g. use any vanilla OpenVPN client with port forwarding working. This also works well when using OpenVPN directly on your network router.

.. but all these things depend on your own usage & how you expect to use it. 99% of VPN users just install a VPN client & call it a day."

Like I click on the log In button and it instantly says error I have contacted customer support, and they don’t even respond. So, I heard good things about express and I was able to sign up for three months free. So I would love peoples opinions in the service both for torrenting and also for Overall internet protection.

I got caught torrenting with VPN,"Hello friends,

I would like to ask for your opinion.

I have my own OpenVPN server, which I use for different things, including downloading torrents.

I have just being contacted by the ISP where I rent the VPS server because Viacom sent them a DMCA copyright violation notice.

I wonder, though... VPN traffic is supposed to be encrypted!!! How on earth has Viacom been able to detect that I was downloading their copyright material?  


What is your best advice to ensure that this will not happen again?

Thanks a lot!"
I got caught torrenting with VPN,"This has been discussed here often - do not use a self-hosted VPN for torrenting unless you know exactly what you're doing. You won't have the shared IP addresses protection of a commercial VPN, nor the logless configuration nor the account without personal information. 

VPN traffic is encrypted but your IP address is visible to the swarm. So they just write down your IP address, check it belongs to datacenter X and send them the notice, which in turn they forward to the account holder - you.

The solution is simple - [get a proper commercial VPN]( and bind."
I got caught torrenting with VPN,"Other comments answered this.

Did the email contain the original sender's e-mail address or headers? If yes would you please send them to me (pastebin/PM). I might be able to give you a few hints.

Overall don't host your own VPN for these purposes in a country/hosting provider that's not on *our side*."

I got caught torrenting with VPN,Get a no log vpn
I got caught torrenting with VPN,"Not too complicated, the VPS you are using responds to DMCA notices & forwards the notices to you. Presumably they expect you to take some action to prevent receiving those notices in the future but you'd need to ask their support about that and/or read the TOS you agreed to.

The VPN itself just connects to your VPS & uses your VPS IP address, no amount of encryption is going to prevent notices from being received at the VPS.

> What is your best advice to ensure that this will not happen again?

Stop torrenting using that VPS. And/or find a VPS outside of DMCA jurisdiction."
I got caught torrenting with VPN,"A lot of people are missing a very important detail - a VPN connection is encrypted, yes, but *only to the other end of the VPN connection*.  From there it goes out unencrypted to the rest of the internet.  Otherwise, nothing would work, because it's all encrypted in a way they can't decrypt.  The primary reason VPN works is that it puts your endpoint in another location (preferably a different country, with less of a focus on these things) with a shared IP so they can't identify you anyway.  Some of the cheaper options instead use a simple proxy, which achieves many of the same goals (although are not recommended, for other reasons)"
I got caught torrenting with VPN,You need a commercial VPN service with a pool of shared IP addresses.
I got caught torrenting with VPN,"The problem is virtual private server company. Yes your IP is hidden but When you connect torrent over the VPN from your VPS, your VPS IP is seen on Torrent Network.

Using VPN for ONLY torrent traffic and nothing else,"Hello everyone, not sure if there is a real solution to this problem as I have searched extensively and found that pretty much the only option is virtualization but I guess I'll ask anyways.

I am in post-secondary and I access my schools network for syncing a OneDrive folder and logging in to a web portal etc. The issue I have is that their network auto flags VPN traffic and resets my account password which is a pain in the ass to reset. I am using Mullvad and split tunneling doesn't seem to work that great especially when I have to use some Windows apps that use my login info so I keep getting flagged unless I turn the whole VPN off while I access their services.

Meanwhile, I have torrents I want to seed so I just want to route only qBittorrent through the VPN and nothing else as to avoid having to turn Mullvad on and off as needed.

I am wondering if such a thing is possible or not without having to set up a virtual machine or use docker or things like that. I simply have no care about my other internet traffic whatsoever, I just want to cover up my torrenting. Maybe I am just asking for too much in this case."

Cloudflare WARP provides privacy for torrenting,"A post talking about a free VPN on here isn't going to go down well, but here it is. WARP is a free VPN with no data cap and it hides your IP in the swarm. When visiting sites, they forward your original IP in the HTTP headers, which is where the claims of 'no privacy' come from. But, torrenting doesn't use HTTP. Test it yourself. Your IP in the torrent swarm will be that of the CloudFlare server you connect to.

Would you rather your own personal IP is visible for copyright notices to be sent to, or that of a CloudFlare VPN server? CloudFlare host torrent sites themselves, I doubt they would respond to a notice about a single VPN user.

I'm definitely not saying we should all end our VPN subscriptions, I'm not ending mine, but to all the people who are very casual torrenters asking for free VPNs on this sub to download a movie or two, WARP works.

I'd really like to know if I'm wrong about this."

Mullvad WireGuard ONLY for qBittorrent on Linux (Split Tunneling),"The main issue is that I want the Mullvad WireGuard to ONLY work with qBittorrent traffic, nothing else, since I have other things running on this server that I want to keep running through the original IP. Unfortunately I'm stuck as I've created a new network interface, but torrents do not download at all

# My Setup

I have done a few things that should result in being able to use qBittorrent over Mullvad WireGuard, but it's not working. What I've done so far:

1. Install qBittorrent (nox). Able to access through web client and works as expected
2. Create [WireGuard config file](
3. Edit WireGuard config file to change `AllowedIPs` to only those used by Mullvad SOCK5 based on [reddit post here]( My config file `mlvd-de11.conf`:

&#x200B;

    [Interface]
    PrivateKey = REDACTED
    Address = 10.65.250.239/32,fc00:bbbb:bbbb:bb01::2:faee/128
    DNS = 193.138.218.74
    
    [Peer]
    PublicKey = REDACTED
    AllowedIPs = 10.64.0.1/32,10.124.0.0/22
    Endpoint = 185.209.196.70:51820

1. Move config file to `/etc/wireguard/mlvd-de11.conf`
2. Use `wg-quick up mlvd-de11` to create new network configuration, output:

&#8203;

    [#] ip link add mlvd-de11 type wireguard
    [#] wg setconf mlvd-de11 /dev/fd/63
    [#] ip -4 address add 10.65.250.239/32 dev mlvd-de11
    [#] ip -6 address add fc00:bbbb:bbbb:bb01::2:faee/128 dev mlvd-de11
    [#] ip link set mtu 1420 up dev mlvd-de11
    [#] resolvconf -a mlvd-de11 -m 0 -x
    [#] ip -4 route add 10.64.0.1/32 dev mlvd-de11
    [#] ip -4 route add 10.124.0.0/22 dev mlvd-de11

1. The network config is added successfully, I go to my qBittorrent client and set `Network Interface` to `mlvd-de11` and restart qBittorrent
2. Unfortunately, downloads do not happen (stuck on metadata or stalled). I've tried selecting Optional IP Address to Bind to, to `10.65.250.239`, to no avail

Is there some settings I'm missing? Should I be setting up the network interface differently through `wg` and `ip`commands? Any pointers would be much appreciated

# Some background:

* This is a Debian server I use Plex, Sonarr/Radarr + Torrent downloading
* I'm not using any Docker containers
* Tried Mullvad CLI split tunneling but that doesn't work (even when excluding all other processes except for qBittorrent)
* When not changing AllowedIPs, and leaving it in default configuration `AllowedIPs =` [`0.0.0.0/0,::0/0`]( I immediately disconnect from SSH and everything breaks (probably means the networking is working though... but not the way I intend)"
Mullvad WireGuard ONLY for qBittorrent on Linux (Split Tunneling),"Hello, I have the same issue. Anyone know how to solve this ?

Thanks"
What can my ISP know about my torrenting while using a VPN?,"Hello,

I'm new to torrenting, my setup is:

\- qBittorrent, with my ""Network Interface"" binded as ""wg-mullvad""

\- Mullvad VPN

\- I tested my connection and torrent client on [ and got no leaks reported

As far as I understand, this should be all that is required for privacy from IP trolls (please correct me if there is something in my setup that is not secure)

How much information can my ISP obtain about my torrenting activities with this setup?

1) Can my ISP see that I am visiting torrent link-distribution sites (when browsing with the VPN enabled)

2) Can my ISP detect that I am downloading and/or seeding torrents?

3) Can my ISP detect what files I am torrenting?

4) Do I need to be concerned over my ISP knowing what they know? (In regards to copyrigth stuff mostly)

Thank you for your help! :)"
What can my ISP know about my torrenting while using a VPN?,"Nothing really. They just see you're connecting and sending traffic to an IP (your mullvad server IP). That's pretty much it. 

They'd have to decrypt your connection to see what you're really doing, trust me, no ISP is going to put in the effort to do/try to do that. 

Just make sure your Killswitch is active Incase the connection ever drops. Other than that you should be set."

What can my ISP know about my torrenting while using a VPN?,"1. Yes, only if your DNS requests somehow leak to your router during reconnects (tip: system-wide DoH or dnscrypt-proxy, I have it as a guide) - but they won't care.

2. No, they can only see you create a lot of traffic

3. No, and the ISPs aren't the watchdogs and never were.

4. They don't care if you don't cause trouble. Though they surely don't like users pushing terabytes either way"

VPN Disconnections,"* Powerful Dell desktop PC.

Within about the last year I've noticed a lot more more unintended disconnects, followed by automatic re-connection. I've tried following the (online) suggestions: changing from ""Automatic"" protocol setting to Lightway UDP and TCP, OpenVPN UDP and TCP, etc.

1. Is this an issue (for security) I should be concerned with? 

2. Is it perhaps due to the AT&T DSL service triggering the short disconnects?

Mullvad IPv6 port forwarding,"I recently signed up for an account with [myanonamouse.net]( and have been trying to configure port forwarding to work properly. I'll try to give as many details as possible to figure out the issue.

First off, my ISP is Spectrum, I'm using a Mac and qbittorrent 4.3.9 is my client. I'm using a Linksys Atlas router if that makes a difference. Both the Mullvad and qbittorrent apps are added to accept incoming connections. All connections on my Mac go through the tunnel and kill switch is set up within the Mullvad app.

I'm using a Los Angeles server with wireguard protocol. First port number I got was in the 55,000 range and I added that to qbittorrent. Mullvad's connection checker said the port was open, but myanonamouse, qbittorrent and [canyouseeme.org]( reported as unreachable. So I changed the port number on Mullvad and got one in the 54,000 range then added it in qbittorrent. Before you ask, I did check with myanonymouse to see what port number were blocked and both numbers weren't in their blocked ranges.

So with the new port number, qbittorrent and [canyouseeme.org]( both report as reachable. I checked myanonymouse and they check both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity. IPv4 is reachable but IPv6 is not. The error I got from them was ""timeout."" On their troubleshooting page, there are two explanations:

1. timeout: This is the most common non-connectable. It means a firewall or router is dropping the connection attempt.
2. For IPv6, it is almost surely always that your firewall is blocking the incoming connection.

Ok, so a firewall is blocking IPv6 connections. It can't be my Mac's firewall because I already added both Mullvad and qbittorrent to the firewall exceptions, so that leaves my router as the culprit, Mullvad's servers or a particular setting that I misconfigured.

So, which one is it? myanonymouse doesn't have a very clear guide on how to fix these issues. Most tutorials are for Windows which involve adding a new network interface (I know how to do that, but I bought the Mac specifically for torrenting and don't want to switch back to my windows desktop for torrenting). Qbittorrent is one of their recommended clients.

EDIT: in another post on this sub, someone recommended downloading a Ubuntu distro torrents as a test since those torrents are always active and it worked. I was able to download and seed without any issues. I should mention that the issue here is that I can't seed any torrents but I can download just fine. qbittorrent can see tens of peers per torrent from myanonymouse and the downloads are pretty fast, but for whatever reason none of the leechers can connect to me."
Mullvad IPv6 port forwarding,"IPv6 isn't reachable because Mullvad blocks it by default. You can enable it on Mullvad settings. As for the port, when other services told you it was unreachable it's probably because qBittorrent wasn't running (so no app was listening that port, which is a requirement for these port check tests)."

My condolences."

That's a weak indicator because what you want to see and prove is your configurations ability to accept incoming connections. You'll easily and quickly connect to other peers, but there are so many seeds, there's little chance someone will connect to you."

*Fallback: Fail (timeout)*

VPN without port forwarding?,"I live in a college apartment that provides internet for us, we just have to log in with our account. I do not have direct access to a router and it’s a public connection, not private. I am just curious as to what port forwarding does and if it’s necessary to do."
VPN without port forwarding?,"You don't need router access to have VPN with port-forwarding.

As for what it is and benefits:

do i need a vpn if i download torrents through real debrid?,"I've always used a VPN but I use LinkSnappy rather than RD partially because LS allows VPN use. Most VPN IPs are blocked on RD iirc. And I'm assuming RD is the same in this regard, if you download a file directly thru their site while using a VPN but then layer try accessing the file on a different a IP it wont let you due to the file being tied to another IP. I use 1dm+ which I'd recommend looking into because it helps with that since it downloads thru them instead and it downloads way faster than thru the debrid site.

But yes I'd say use a VPN, I mean if you have one there's no reason not to use it."
do i need a vpn if i download torrents through real debrid?,Your ISP likely isn’t monitoring for torrents & copyright violations.  Copyright holders pay other organizations to join the torrents and collect IPs of everyone seeding the torrent.  Then they send violation notices with IPs and the name of the copyrighted material to ISPs who pass the notices along to their users.  It’s always a good idea to use VPN when torrenting.

Accidental Download without a VPN,"I accidently downloaded a movie without a vpn, and someone on one of these threads put a link to a download check website, and sure enough the movie showed up there. They said you'll be sure to get a letter if anything shows up there. Is there anyway to clear this? I deleted the download and everything, but it stays in the history there."
Accidental Download without a VPN,"It's just a letter. Learn from it and move on.

Bind qBit to your VPN. This stops all torrent traffic if your VPN drops it's connection.

In qBittorrent, go to Settings > Advanced > Network interface and select your VPN interface.

If you don't know which is your VPN, disconnect it and see which interface disappears."
Accidental Download without a VPN,Nope. What link did they give you?
Accidental Download without a VPN,"Love letters are weird. Your internet provider sends them, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that the movie producer was forwarded your IP or is even aware that you downloaded. The internet company won’t sue and those letters are generally auto generated when your IP is found in a swarm. Its not a good thing, but it’s not the end of the world either

It might not help, but if you want to hedge your bets it’s probably a good idea to delete your dns history and hard reboot your router. It’s in the record but depending on your service provider a hard reboot to your modem may give you a new IP address is they don’t assign you a static one. To my surprise, some internet providers still provide rolling IPs

Edit: also if you can changing the DNS server from the default isn’t the worst idea either"

Accidental Download without a VPN,"Piracy detectors must join the download swarm. If they do, then they can get a list of IPs who have chunks available for download of that torrent. Once you have left the swarm, that is shut your client or removed that torrent then they cannot track you. If you were there then they have your IP. They then have to write to each ISP.

After that, what happens depends on your country. In the US, they normally give you up to three strikes via your ISP. In other countries like Germany, hey might immediately go to lawyers.

Now the IKNOWWHATYOUDOWNLOAD website goes by IP address. In some countries that changes. It could tell what a previous tenant used downloaded.

Best to use a real VPN. One that does not track you."
Accidental Download without a VPN,Great discussion! What if it's not torrenting? What if one were to have videos stored in something like Mega cloud storage and then we're to stream directly from Mega and Chromecast using something like VLC? VPN necessary?
Accidental Download without a VPN,"Nothing you can now do, unlikely you will receive a letter. While VPN provides better anonymity, a big caution with Public Paid VPN.  Always use a dedicated device, like Raspberry PI or Virtual Machine, as once you activate the VPN you loose all protection from your home router\\firewall (default settings block key attacks and block  inbound traffic that isn't port forwarded or return outbound).  This means you are directly exposed and at the mercy of your VPN provider to protect you from unwanted inbound traffic and other VPN users on the subnet.You can mitigate this via;

\- Host Based Firewall (Windows or Linux Inbuilt Firewalls), set to block all incoming traffic and only add in-bound rules for traffic you expect and want.  Windows is actually pretty good here, and detect the VPN as a PUBLIC network and apply stricter rules.  DO NOT change this to PRIVATE!!- Never store any sensitive on personal information on the device using Public VPN due to the high-exposure

The above does NOT apply to Corporate VPN which your company uses to protect you and their sensitive data, as they don't trust your home network.

PS: Could start a debate about newsgroups, IRC vs Torrents.If you have to pay for VPN just for torrents, then potentially paying a newsgroup provider is a very good alternative.  But to compare you also need to pay for decent indexer and backup provider for those missing blocks.  On the plus, no VPN and super fast download speeds and often quicker releases as you don't need to wait for seeders to first download."

Best VPN for routing to international severs (gaming),"Hello,

Just wondering what is the best VPN that optimize routing/sever hops to oversea severs? I frequently play games with my friends who live a couple time zones away and wanted to keep my ping (RTT) low and consistent. I've been using  NordVPN with some success, it keeps my ping consistently lower than usual but sometimes suffer from package loss. Just wondering if there are better alternatives? 

I know that VPN cannot decrease RTT beyond what is physically capable. However, for me VPN seems to give better severs routing/hops than my ISP so it gives a consistently low ping. When not using VPN, my ping is not always high but sometimes i got bad routing which can bring it up above 200."
Best VPN for routing to international severs (gaming),"Ovpn.com , they offer 7day money back if you not happy."
Best VPN for routing to international severs (gaming),Better use a DNS instead. DNS rerouting usually gives you much faster pings and theoretically no reduction in speed.

Best VPN for routing to international severs (gaming),"> I know that VPN cannot decrease RTT beyond what is physically capable.

Not true, because your connection is not always taking the most optimal route.

About 5 years ago I've seen a VPN service that was operating in Asia/Oceania and promised better ping. Maybe there're other niche offerings today but most VPNs don't care about it. At this point it comes down to trial and error."

NordVPN vs ExpressVPN vs Surfshark,"So the past couple of weeks I did some research into VPN providers, and after reading many (way too many) VPN reviews I eventually came to the 3 providers mentioned in the title based on this list:

I want to use the VPN for torrenting and streaming US Netflix (I'm currently in Australia) and was wondering if any of the 3 is better, or if they're all the same pretty much.

EDIT: Thanks for the comments everyone! I found my new VPN provider and it is the best VPN with the fastest servers I have ever used -- ExpressVPN actually increased my connection speed with some torrents.

Turkish investigators seized an ExpressVPN server which they say was used to delete relevant information from the assassin's Gmail and Facebook accounts.


So moral of the story. Express VPN got your back even if you want to get rid of information that would aid in a homicide investigation, and they'll never know who did it. And where. It'll just lead them to a data center with a server from Express VPN. And it will contain no information because Express VPN doesn't keep logs.

If someone could give me the rundown on wtf this program even is and whether it even supports P2P and/or port  forwarding  that would be cool.  Mostly just curious to what this  program even is in  the first place esp. with bold claims being better than Wireguard, so most likely I'll just be saying to ""hi"" to IVPN or Mullvad in the future."
"Authenticity of Firetrusts ""HideAway VPN""?",[deleted]
"Authenticity of Firetrusts ""HideAway VPN""?","Just looking at their website makes me suspicious. There are a lot of marketing words and not many details or technical info. They don’t specify the VPN protocol, which means that it’s proprietary. Laughably, in their FAQ on this point, is says they use TCP and UDP protocols as if that means anything.

They are leaning heavily into their custom traffic routing feature and it’s extremely unclear if the feature *actually exists* now or is “coming soon!” They erroneously claim that making such rules is “impossible” with other VPN providers. This is *blatantly false*. With standard VPN software (like OpenVPN) you can make whatever traffic rules you want, it’s called a “split tunnel”. It’s not always user-friendly but it’s very common. 

Their speed claims are meaningless without further documentation. Their four cropped Ookla Speedtest screenshots don’t prove anything.  

Go with another provider. I would guess that there’s a high chance of your P2P connections escaping the VPN due to their traffic routing rules."
"Authenticity of Firetrusts ""HideAway VPN""?","I agree. Anything that has more marketing than technical data is a red flag for a cash grab. In more pleasant terms it means they dont care about you, only their business. I bet their website has a lot of tracking for marketing reasons."

Binded VPN yet qBittorent seeded without VPN connection??,"Hi all,

Last month, I binded qBittorrent to my PIA VPN connection and tested thoroughly over a couple days to ensure that anytime the VPN was off, qBittorrent would stop uploading/downloading. Checked on the checker/tracker websites to confirm my personal IP was not leaking anywhere and that everything was done through the VPN. Everything worked great.

Fast forward to today, I just noticed qBittorrent was running in the background over the last couple days without my knowledge. No biggie, I assumed, until I opened it up and noticed EVERYTHING was being seeded without my VPN on. 

Now my personal IP shows everything I've been seeding. 

I checked the binding options and ""Network interface"" still showed the VPN client binded to qBittorrent. 

How did this leak through? Why is qBittorrent still seeding without my VPN? I re-binded it just now and it's working as it should be but what just happened?"
Binded VPN yet qBittorent seeded without VPN connection??,What's your OS? Did you reinstall/update the VPN or did it self-update during this period?
Binded VPN yet qBittorent seeded without VPN connection??,"What version of qBittorrent?

What OS? Docker?"
Binded VPN yet qBittorent seeded without VPN connection??,"If you have IPv6 activated on your VPN, turn it off right away, and on optional IP addresses to bind to, only allow IPv4 addresses."
"Just Moved in last week, spectrum already DMCA noticed me even though i was using a VPN?","Hi!

I just got my spectrum service up last week. Using nordVPN i started downloading some movies to my new Plex media server and today i already got a content strike from spectrum! the only thing i can think of is that i paused the torrents and turned off the VPN for an hour yesterday so i could have faster upload speeds for something unrelated. could they have gotten my IP when the VPN was off even though all torrents were paused and had zero upload or download happening on them? 

Thanks!"
"Just Moved in last week, spectrum already DMCA noticed me even though i was using a VPN?",I'm sure you didn't have your VPN bound to the client.
"Just Moved in last week, spectrum already DMCA noticed me even though i was using a VPN?",Read the sticky thread of the subreddit
"Just Moved in last week, spectrum already DMCA noticed me even though i was using a VPN?",Best practice is to set your DL client to only be allowed to use the VPN network interface.
"Just Moved in last week, spectrum already DMCA noticed me even though i was using a VPN?",I have zero confidence in Bittorrent. I literally uninstall it if I am not using my VPN. That app has a mind of it's own!
"Just Moved in last week, spectrum already DMCA noticed me even though i was using a VPN?",It probably don't help that Nord keeps logs of what you do. Try a different VPN like PIA or something. But be careful especially with Spectrum.
No Direct Connection with VPN Binding.,"Hello, looking for some advice.  


My setup is all on an old desktop as my server.  
I use plex and several \*arr services.   
I use qBittorent. Windscribe for VPN. I have been split tunneling only qBittorent.  
I can see my IP is shown correctly in google, then I use ""CheckMyTorrentIP"" and it shows the expected IP from the VPN.

I received 2 copyright emails and now I see I need to bind the VPN to qBittorrent. Sounded easy enough, but I am having issues. This level of network troubleshooting is getting beyond my scope.

The network connections show 4 options. 1 is my normal LAN. 1 is Windscribe IKEv2 which is connected. The other 2 say Local Area Connection, with a windscribe specific label below it, but these are disconnected. I bound qBittorent to the IKEv2 connection. It will show a connection to nodes, but clearly says no direct connection. qBittorent has a lot of options for the network interface, many being jumbled messes of letters/numbers, and still shows the 4 network options I mentioned.

I still have the Windscribe app in split tunnel with the only process in it being qBittorent. Currently all my other internet access is fine. I also have messed with the preferred IP option but it had no effect.

I also messed with port forwarding in router settings to point at qBittorent, but was unsure if or how that works with a VPN.

I would appreciate any advice."
No Direct Connection with VPN Binding.,"When this has happened in the past, resetting qbit to default preferences had fixed it for me. Just remember to rebind the IP and reapply any other changes you had set.

You'll have to delete the config files here
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\qBittorrent

Just make sure you're in the roaming folder and not appdata/local or you'll remove all of your active torrents. Do this while qbit is not running"
No Direct Connection with VPN Binding.,No direct connection means no incoming connection means no port-forwarding means Windscribe.
No Direct Connection with VPN Binding.,"Update: after my initial post I went to work. 
I received an automated notification that something downloaded last night.
I woke up this morning and checked my setup. 

QBittorrent said it had direct connection. Settings showed bound network. Google showed normal IP. CheckMyTorrentIP showed VPN IP.

So currently everything seems fine?"

Unless they work directly in the areas that handle these notices, the odds are they are effectively completely separated.  Even terminating their ISP access account would be unconnected to their employment.

Do VPN's fail sometimes? He uses uTorrent and ProtonVPN (Basic plan). Is ProtonVPN a good one?"
"ISP warned, not sure why VPN failed",You need to blind your torrent client to the network the VPN used on your computer so it can ONLY access the internet through that one and should it fail it would be unable to use your regular connection.

I don't need various locations, just a specific one location (Los Angeles or Atlanta) and to keep my phone connected to is 24/7 without me needing to constantly check if I'm connected.

I currently use premium VPN SuperUnlimited but every now and then it pushes me out of the VPN.

I'm using an iPhone 7 if it matters.  
I also got a USA sim card to help.

My main goal is using social media like TikTok, to see content (and publish content) to the USA audience.

What's a good VPN service for my needs?  
Or maybe there's some other way to do it maybe even without a VPN service?

BTW, I'm definitely willing to pay, just not an exaggerated sum.  
Maybe about 10-15 USD per month.

Thank you!"

Best court proven VPN got online gaming,"""Court proven""?

You will absolutely never be able to find a single VPN that has a good enough connection speed or ping to use for gaming. They're barely fast enough for regular internet browsing and video streaming.

VPNs are literally sending all of your communications from your PC, to another PC (server) and then to ""the internet"" and then back to the other PC (server) and then back to your PC again.

Other than a fundamental change in physics itself, nothing will ever change this fact."

Couple Of Questions,"So I just checked IKWYD and it looks like my nord vpn dropped and I got a notice that it saw an old show from the 90s on my list - I don’t know if it is safe to say the exact show in case my isp sees this but it is a sitcom (less popular than Friends, Seinfeld, etc). It was “seen” for less than a minute. I really cannot afford to get a DMCA my broadband provider here in the USA is mad at me and my parents. Is it random how they give the complaint out or is it not? Like would they not give one out for an older show? 

I put the vpn right back on. The problem is that when I try to bind my vpn to the network using your steps when I turn the vpn off and I relaunch Qbittorrent it shows the exact same interface options as when the vpn was on even after restarting it and restarting qbit. I’m not sure if I should post them here or not for privacy reasons. I even tried with the Apple terminal steps and nothing happened. 

That brings me to another question. If I am in the USA, and the USA shows New York as the vpn from nord, since it is illegal in the USA, if I’m going to torrent do I use the NY,USA server or do I use a server from a country where torrenting is legal? 

After this bad luck, I think its best to quit torrenting. I started in June and just got my first notice in February. My isp is not a big chain too so they would be able to track me and kick me off there service.

Edited to add: is seeding the way that your isp catches you or is it downloading as well. If it is seeding is there a safe way to do it without isp knowing?"
Couple Of Questions,">I don’t know if it is safe to say the exact show in case my isp sees this

lol

>Is it random how they give the complaint out or is it not? Like would they not give one out for an older show?

I'd say it's random for older shows unless they are super popular.

>The problem is that when I try to bind my vpn to the network

That's not a thing. Bind qBit to VPN network interface.

>if I’m going to torrent do I use the NY,USA server

Whichever Nord says is 'ok' to use for P2P.

>[ISP] would be able to track

They won't.

>your isp catches you 

Your ISP doesn't monitor your torrenting, copyright trolls do. Your ISP just forwards their notices to you.

>is seeding the way that [they] catch you or is it downloading as well.

Just being connected to the torrent swarm."
Couple Of Questions,"> do I use a server from a country where torrenting is legal? 

imho should always use a different country

Posting interface options is safe, it only has a name. IPv6 should be mostly redacted, for IPv4 its enough to redact the first 2 numbers (there're only few special first numbers: 127.x.x.x / 172.x.x.x / 10.x.x.x / 192.168.x.x). I dont understand what you have going by your description"
Can't get Mullvad port forwarding working.,"Hi I just decided to try Mullvad, and on their website I did the port forward for a wireguard port. But it still says it can't connect to the port, and qbittorrent says no direct connections, when set to that port & ethernet device.

Sudden problem with transfer rates,"I've been having a weird problem with my transfer rates which up until a couple days ago were typically very fast and smooth. Whats happening is a torrent will connect, the DL rate will reach its typical speed, and then drop to zero, climb back up, and drop to zero. Its not just going slow its clearly shooting down to zero every few seconds, reducing transfers to a crawl.  


Very unsure whats causing this. My connection is fast and constant outside of torrenting. I am using a VPN (Mullvad), I'm on a Mac (fairly older on, High Sierra) using Transmission as my client. Despite my computers age, my connections have been fast and fine up till a few days ago.  Also it doesn't seem to matter what the file size or source of the torrent is. Just felt I should include it.  I don't know how to check my transfer ratio on Transmission, but I feel like it should be pretty good as I try to seed everything for as long as possible.  


I searched this and similar reddits for this issue and the only time I found a similar issue was it had to do with hard drive space but I still have about 100GB free on my HD and the torrents I'm downloading aren't that large. Thanks for any and all advice."
Sudden problem with transfer rates,"Try qBittorrent and downloading to an external disk, then report back"
Torrents are stalled and won't download or upload?,"I posted in /r/qbittorrent and /r/privateinternetaccess too to see who has any ideas. I'm pretty confused right now.

This started maybe a day or two ago, and I've made no changes to hardware or software since. I have a bunch of torrents, but none of them are downloading or uploading. They're all in the ""stalled"" status, and when I click the trackers for each torrent, the status all say ""Not working"" and the message is either ""Permission denied"" or ""A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond"".

I can add new torrents, but they usually just stall and do nothing, even after I force resume them. I'm trying to recheck all of my torrents, but of the ones that have been rechecked, they just go back into ""Stalled uploading"".

I've tried updating qbittorrent, changing the port for incoming connections, and nothing seems to work. I use PIA as a VPN and I checked my subscription and my username and password and they're all working. Anyone have any idea why everything is stalled? I have the same problem on Mac, except the Message in the Trackers view says ""timed out"" for all of them.

I also installed BitTorrent to see if it makes a difference, and the problem still exists. The torrent gets added, the Status on the main window says ""Connecting to peers 0.0%"", and the Status in  Trackers says ""Connection timed out."" So I can't tell if this is somehow a problem with privateinternetaccess, or is my ISP somehow stopping this or what is going on?"
Torrents are stalled and won't download or upload?,"You need to try a couple of more things to help narrow it down. Some examples:

- Did you bind? If so, unbind and rebind while double checking the interface is correct. 

- The torrents only have a few seeders/peers? Then make use of PIA port-forwarding and change the port to the one they give you: 

- Are they all from the same tracker? Perhaps you've been banned. Try another. Try also a different server in case the ban is IP based.

- Could your firewall be blocking UDP traffic? Try OpenVPN TCP as PIA doesn't have Wireguard TCP. 

- Does it work without VPN? Try downloading an ubuntu torrent (rebind afterwards).

Report back after you try those, good luck.

Edit: could be a PIA problem maybe - "

Need VPN recommendations for a specific purpose,"I'm looking for a VPN provider that, besides granting me more protection whilst torrenting, would also enable me to access Eurosport Player.

Torrent downloads won't start when using NordVPN but do when VPN is off.,"I am on a Windows 11 laptop and I have the default settings for qBittorrent.

When I turn the VPN off everything immediately connects and starts downloading as normal. I honestly don't know what DHT is but it fluctuates between 60-70.

Why do so many people still download without VPNs?,I was monitoring Torrent swarms for fun and I had my client resolve the IP addresses. I was genuinely surprised at how many users weren't using VPNs to download torrents. This doesn't only apply to non-DCMA countries but a lot of the G7 countries as well. Is it just a lack of education on the subject or just that the risk of DCMA/Lawsuit isn't as big as we all might think it is?

Why do so many people still download without VPNs?,DMCA notices are more of a US thing.

The only country that actually prosecutes downloading torrents is Germany which you can get around by using a vpn.
Why do so many people still download without VPNs?,Why do people with VPNs not set their torrent client to only use the VPN adapter?  Instead they think the VPN kill switch will protect them.

Why do so many people still download without VPNs?,">  Is it just a lack of education on the subject or just that the risk of DCMA/Lawsuit isn't as big as we all might think it is?

Paying for a VPN service is a real cost you see every month. But most people will never face prosecution even if they download one illegal movie every day for the rest of their lives. So paying for a service whose need is dubious (in the context of torrents) doesn't seem like a good idea for them.

I know this depends highly on location. I'm paying for a VPN service. But if my only goal was torrenting I would not pay for one. I've never met anyone that has gotten a notice or a lawsuit. I've also never met anyone that knows anyone else that has gotten a notice or a lawsuit."

"Comcast throttling torrents over VPN, how?","Ok, this one has me scratching my head. I normally torrent over VPN through Comcast. I have regular speeds of 250 and up. One day a few weeks back I forgot to use VPN and I got the DCMA email. Ever since then, when I try to torrent over VPN i can barely get a 2GB movie downloaded in a day, something which took 15 minutes. It's not my setup, I just used my phone's hotspot and got the same torrent down in 10 minutes which has been torrenting for hours over VPN and Comcast.

Question, how can Comcast see me torrenting over VPN? What can I do to circumvent whatever they are doing?"
"Comcast throttling torrents over VPN, how?","I believe that they still know when you are using a vpn, that they just cannot see the traffic it contains.  Is all of your traffic throttled on the vpn or just torrent traffic? Like running speed tests etc or streaming is that limited?"
"Comcast throttling torrents over VPN, how?","Likely just throttling UDP traffic or the default VPN ports.

Try changing ports, or using WireGuard/OpenVPN TCP (WG TCP available on Mullvad only). The speeds aren't as good as UDP but if you're getting throttled it shouldn't be as bad.

If persists, you can use multi-hop / bridge (Shadowsocks proxy) or use HTTPS/obfs4 obfuscation that some VPNs have (eg. Cryptostorm). At this stage they could still know you're using a VPN but it's hard."

Am I screwed?,"I am living in Germany and have a VPN server that I host on DO in the Netherlands. Obviously DO has my address and so on. Today I connected to my VPN server and I was torrenting a file. Withing a few hours I got an email from DO today that I have some activity that falls under torrenting of copyrighted material and they received a DMCA notice. I stopped sharing that content.

Would DO share my data with the company that filed a complaint? Should I be worried?

UPDATE (a month later): 

I deleted account on DO the next day. It's been over a month and nothing happened =)"
Am I screwed?,"Likely not, but I would still terminate the account. This is why you don't use a DIY VPN with a dedicated IP address tied to your name and address."
Am I screwed?,"As long as you're downloading it's normally ""okay"", Stichting Brein normally only pursuits people who proactively share movies. So if you're uploading consistently it's more of a problem, but a few MBs here and there normally doesn't draw a lot of attention. Regulations haven't been favorable the past 5 or 6 years.

I use the free version of Cryptostorm, I found out about it on Reddit after tiger died on me, and to be honest it's pretty good. It works perfectly fine for popular / recent torrents and they have a 0 log policy. 0 bandwidth & data caps. They don't inject your traffic with ads either."

"Torrent Client binded, still leaking IP","Following the guides posted here, i binded qbitt to my VPN (Mullvad). However i'm checking iknowwhatyoudownload, and one of the torrents that i downloaded showed up there on my real IP. What could be the issue here? Both qbitt and mullvad are updated to the latest version, and i always start up the vpn first thing on boot up. I tested to see if the binding was set up correctly by attempting to download the ubuntu torrent with the vpn off, and it indeed did not download. I didnt mess with other settings on qbitt or mullvad, aside from enabling split tunneling on a few programs. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Something interesting in the IKWYD page: the 'First Seen' and 'Last Seen' show the exact same time, e.g 10:24:27 AM for both times, implying that it was a split second disconnect. Not sure what to make of that."
"Torrent Client binded, still leaking IP","Either that torrent showing up on IKWYD was downloaded before you binded, or you're accessing the website with VPN connected and thus it shows what you downloaded... with VPN."
"Torrent Client binded, still leaking IP",Different service but I’ve found split tunnel to be unreliable and keep it off. See if that fixes it.
"Torrent Client binded, still leaking IP",That is kind of scary . I have heard nothing but good stuff about mullvad and have considered trying them out one day . I wonder what happened.

Is udp and plain-HTTP traffic with a torrent tracker encrypted in any fashion?,Just curious.
Is udp and plain-HTTP traffic with a torrent tracker encrypted in any fashion?,"Great question. The answer is no and no:

- HTTP, part of initial BT protocol 

- UDP, a later extension: 

This means the only way to have secure communications with the tracker is HTTPS. Don't forget if you are using public torrents this is not of concern to you, your activity is already public on the DHT."

Torguard speedtest?,"Speeds are good. I have been with them for a couple of years. Keep in mind, these VPNs contract POPs from a third party so you are subject to the whims of that third party. I have found the Eastern US POPs get very congested during business hours. Overall if you have some patience it's workable if you don't mind hunting around for a server 8-5 M-F.

Now the bad news. The client absolutely sucks. If it finds an open slot it will connect just fine, if not all mayhem breaks loose. You will get an endless supply of excuses and requests for logs from support. They will blame your A/V or whatever they can come up with. So why is it their client has so many problems while others have none? I don't doubt the security of their set up.

The good news is I did grab a deal for $15 every 6 months recurring which is hard to beat, that's why I stick around.  They do support WireGuard which is the latest and greatest so it's not all bad if you don't mind having to restart your system sometimes while hunting a connection during the busy times."

Torrent Client Binding / Mullvad Split Tunneling,"> Would not enabling that option, and keeping split tunneling on present any security issue for torrenting, even if binded?

If you do not bind then you rely on the software quality of your VPN client. History shows that 99% are bad and engage in false advertisement.

My advice is to bind the address for anything **critical**. If this is not possible, setup a local SOCKS proxy that has this option and route select traffic through the proxy, most apps have proxy settings.

If that's still not possible then your only way is to create an elaborate setup with Virtual Machines or network namespaces on Linux so the traffic actually cannot escape if VPN is down / disconnected.

For all intents and purposes binding qB is enough and the only leak-free measure."

Can the government and companies track me down when downloading through torrents when Mullvad VPN is enabled? I just started the vpn client and clicked secure connection. Is there anything else that I need to be doing to be secure? Thank you"
Noob here. Looking to get a vpn.,"So after my mate saw my gaming laptop in person when I when back to visit the states, he asked if I have a vpn and said no. Then suggested I should look into getting one. 

That happened during the holidays and now I’m back abroad for university. (Puerto Rico) 

And that’s why I’m here. What is the best VPN in your opinion?  What do you think is the best VPN for torrenting, streaming, and gaming, respectiviely? 

I'm a college student, so I don’t want something to expensive to. Based on yt videos, it seems a lot of people sponsored NordVPN and ExpressVPN. 

Cyberghost has like this 3 years+3 months plan for $2.15 which looks nice, but is it?

Anyway TLDR: I want a VPN recommendation that’s good for keeping things anonymous and also the occasional streaming/gaming whenever I got free time to do so and ideally affordable since I’m at university and gotta manage my money adequately."
Noob here. Looking to get a vpn.,"Torrenting: [any of these 4]( but go with Mullvad if you're a beginner.

Streaming: OVPN, maybe.

Gaming: none, use a proxy instead.

Avoid: NordVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access, Cyberghost, Zenmate, ProtonVPN."
Noob here. Looking to get a vpn.,"For strict torrenting you  Mullvad or AirVPN. However, since you want some streaming and gaming I would probably take a look at OVPN.  I would test all 3 to see what fits you best."
Noob here. Looking to get a vpn.,"Stay away form Nord, period. The best 3 in order are Mullvad, Proton and IVPN. The only free one is DewVPN. 

"
Noob here. Looking to get a vpn.,"PIA is actually a great VPN. With a promo code, I pay about $5 a month. It’s very user friendly, feature rich, and I’ve never had an issue with it."
Noob here. Looking to get a vpn.,"honestly to me mullvad is a QoL thing. you can probably get away with real-debrid or if you need to torrent even nord but they have... privacy issues and you probably want to support mullvad if you can (like buying chickens raised in a better farm for example). for streaming i'd say the more locations the better so maybe it is just nord, and for gaming, why game on a vpn?"
Noob here. Looking to get a vpn.,"You don't need a VPN in Puerto Rico. If you want ~~anonymity~~ a little more privacy, first start by getting rid of ad tracking with browser extensions: [this youtube channel]( has a lot of great videos

If you're gonna torrent you can just google if anyone got in trouble at a university in your country. I doubt.

Cyberghost doesnt offer port-forwarding, you better [choose a VPN]( that suits all your needs, since you're asking here"

Does anyone use proton vpn (free) on firestick? Does it work for streaming torrents?,"Does Proton work well with the fire stick?

Is it safe to stream torrents on say stremio? I hear you need a p2p connecttion for protection with downloading torrents is that true for streaming also ?"
Does anyone use proton vpn (free) on firestick? Does it work for streaming torrents?,Does proton free version allow tormenting? Most free vpns won't let you do that or would give you unusable speeds for streaming
I'm looking to get into torrenting,And im wondering because im broke if windscribe 2€/month is good?
I'm looking to get into torrenting,Mullvad seems to be a fan favorite round these parks… as long as you have a VPN with certain features mentioned in the megathread you’re good to go
I'm looking to get into torrenting,"MullVad is a favorite for sure. But it's almost 2.5x what your talking about windscribe.

Get windscribe if you can afford it and give it a go. No matter what some protection is better than none. I've never personally used it nor read reviews about it. Take everything you hear and see with a grain of salt. Some sites sponsor certain Vpns therefore will give it a higher rating. Find 10 different review sites or YouTube videos see what stands out and what you can afford."

"Trying to torrent over VPN, but the download is going super slow (New to torrenting)","I am very new to torrenting.

"Trying to torrent over VPN, but the download is going super slow (New to torrenting)","Bittorrent protocol has seeders (people who finished downloading the file and are only uploading) and peers (people both downloading and uploading). Generally speaking, a torrent will download faster if it has a good amount of seeders/peers. Peers are also important should you wish to seed.

In your case I assume there's not many seeders/peers for that torrent and you're using a VPN which performs poorly in such cases and others (eg. seeding) due to the lack of port-forwarding. You'd do better [with a VPN that supports it]( as it'll improve your swarm connectivity and facilitate DHT / PeX.

To provide more information, port-forwarding basically makes you able to initialize connections and not being dependent of others. So for example if there's a torrent with 10 users and 7 aren't port-forwarded, you'll only be able to connect to 3. On the other hand, if you have port-forwarding you'll be able to connect to those 10. What happens is that many users do hit-and-runs of popular torrents so they don't notice a speed difference as there'll always be +100 connectable seeders. However, when you're trying to seed or download not so popular torrents (<20 seeders), the performance impact is quite significant and it's where a VPN with port-forwarding shines - [as shown in this benchmark video]("
Noob here. How to know if VPN has cut out while I'm away?,"I have no reason to think that it has, just curious and if possible I wanna have the option to check.

I'm using Nord (I'm not the one paying for it and I have permission to use it so that's why I'm not on Mullvad for example) and I always get notifications on Windows when connecting to a server. So if I don't see any additional ones there, should I be good (and does anyone know if I can check on the Nord app for example)? Thanks!"

Was looking at Deeperconnect and Firewalla, but I don't think they do VPN like the services do.  Currently I have been using Private Internet Access for 5 years or so. Its been fine but its slow.  I tweaked settings etc, and on a good day can get like 6 down versus 8-10 down without it on.  Most days though its more like 1-2.5 down.  If hardware is not an option, any suggestions for software VPN that is reasonably priced.  I pay somewhere in the 30's per year for Private Internet Access.  Don't mind switching, but don't really want to pay over 30-50 a year for VPN."

Many people on here will say get mullvad or a VPN with a portforwarding feature.

I have 100s of TBs of upload within a year...without a portforwarding VPN. As a matter of fact, some of the ""least reputable"" VPNs got me that(not bragging just showing the fact portforwarding had made me no difference and id be glad to show 100s of TBs of upload + join dates avg about 550gb upload/day). Port forwarding was much bigger pre 2020 when ISPs had a much smaller pool of ports to block on routers. If you're a casual seeder (1-500 torrents) the maybe Mullvad is for you. Once your seeding over 1000 no port forwarding feature is going to matter unless you download just garbage Torrents no one wants. I'll get a lot of hate for this but I really don't care. I have my results without a portforwarding VPN, my own proof.

I did try mullvad, and in all honesty it's not that bad. Not a fan of the payment system. But it is annonomous and not really linked to you in anyway besides your payment method. No username, no password, no email. I can say it's the best I've seen maybe in terms of privacy. But If you seed enough you'll max your upload (speed, what you are specifically asking for if you have to get a VPN) non stop 24/7.

If you are concerned about privacy #1 get MullVad, otherwise find one you like with the features you wan with the price you want with the speeds you want. Just stay away from IPVanish If you want good speeds. That one I can assure you, will be worse than what you have. Try free trials.

In my experience every VPN I've used has had a much bigger speed dent in Downloading than uploading. Minus IPVanish I almost always get my full upload speed on most VPNs I've tried, even close to full upload on overseas servers (about a 8 percent drop vs domestic)."

Seeding music files without VPN,"I am on a private music tracker.  A few months ago another member on the site mentioned that he/she never uses a VPN when seeding, only when connecting to the site.

Seeding music files without VPN,"If you only use your client for this private music tracker, you rely on the probability  that there are no copyright trolls secretly inside the community. It makes ZERO sense to use VPN for the website (forum) but not the torrent client, because your client will connect to their tracker server ( and leave log traces there. This is important for the rare cases where administrators have a strong outside incentive to save their own asses.

If you continue to use bittorrent outside the safe haven of the closed community, you become an easy target practice as your experience has shown."

"Nord VPN is being sketchy, I don't like the way this sound what about u all?","Update January 21, 2022: NordVPN notes (via) on its website that it “will only comply with requests from foreign governments and law enforcement agencies if these requests are delivered according to laws and regulations.” It adds that it will “never log their activity unless ordered by a court in an appropriate, legal way.”

&#x200B;

NordVPN tells us that the standard no-logging policy remains in place. It will challenge any logging requests until all options are exhausted and will use all means to keep customers informed. At the same time, the company wants to dissociate itself from bad actors in the VPN industry while sending a clear message to terrorists and criminals that it will not work as a safe haven for crime."

Original story:  
NordVPN is clarifying that it will comply with information requests from international law enforcement after publishing a blog post in 2017 saying that it wouldn’t.    
  
The company pointed out the change to PCMag on Wednesday, a day after Europol announced it had shut down a separate VPN provider called VPNLabs.net for allegedly facilitating cybercrime. In the same announcement, Europol implied VPNLab.net had refused to cooperate with authorities, which led to the takedown.   
  
“We will comply with lawful requests as long as they are delivered according to all the laws and regulations,"" NordVPN says. ""We are a company that protects the security and privacy of our customers, but we operate according to laws and regulations.”  
  
The statement is notably different from what NordVPN wrote in a 2017 blog post when addressing how the company handled warrants and subpoenas from government agencies.    
  
“NordVPN operates under the jurisdiction of Panama and will not comply with requests from foreign governments and law enforcement agencies,” the company said at the time.   
  
However, it seems NordVPN edited the original blog post on Wednesday to change the phrasing. The post now reads: “NordVPN operates under the jurisdiction of Panama and will only comply with requests from foreign governments and law enforcement agencies if these requests are delivered according to laws and regulations.”"
"Nord VPN is being sketchy, I don't like the way this sound what about u all?","Any vpn will comply to a court order, they will sacrifice some customers  inorder to save their business. A vpn not being located in 5/14eyes has nothing to do with it"
"Nord VPN is being sketchy, I don't like the way this sound what about u all?","If a VPN has to publicly tell you this, something is wrong.. imjs.. I wouldn't even trust it and move to something else. Nord isn't even that good feature wise anyways and their support is absolutely horrid."
"Nord VPN is being sketchy, I don't like the way this sound what about u all?","Then what's the difference between Nord and regular ISPs? You use VPN to prevent governments from spying on you, because ISPs are able and happy to hand over your data, if the VPN does the same you just pay for absolutely nothing"

Surfshark website bypass problems," 

I  am living somewhere that has an extremely restrictive network admin and  no possibility of setting up my own connection. I got network banned  for torrenting once, and so many legal websites are blackholed that it's  just outrageous.

For example, the  surfshark site itself is blackholed. I first got NordVPN (strangely not  blackholed), but most of its servers are blocked. Their obfuscation  protocol also didn't work for long, and soon I couldn't connect with it.

But  I got surfshark before that happened, and so far it is working fine  using the openVPN TCP protocol. I'm concerned that I will eventually be  sniffed out for weird looking traffic and no apparent DNS queries, so I  decided to add some apps and websites that I use frequently to the VPN  bypass.

My concern is that the  bypass does not seem to be working. My bank won't let me log in on a  VPN, and adding it to bypass makes no difference. In fact I have to kill  surfshark altogether to log in, and that tells me that there is no VPN  bypass happening at all.

Thoughts?  Advice? I would like to quietly stay on this or another affordable VPN  and not have to go to the trouble of evading another network ban since  it doesn't seem as easy to do on this new laptop. Any advice about how to do that?

Side  note: I have to login to the wifi network with DHCP. I am far from  being a network expert, but does that only look at my mac address or  also at my computer name?"
Surfshark website bypass problems,"If by VPN bypass you mean split tunneling, then perhaps it's not working as intended on Surfshark? Start by confirming if your IP address indeed changed, or for example having one browser for going inside the tunnel and other outside. If still not working, try using a 3rd-party open-source app with split tunneling (eg. Tunnelblick for macOS) and Surfshark OpenVPN TCP configurations.

Mullvad,"

Mullvad does not collect much personal information about you. It does not offer ads for vpn reviews. Lots of positive reviews here from many users.
You don't need to buy a long-term subscription - the price is always 5 euros per month!


You can explore the criteria for a good vpn for torrenting:
"
Mullvad,"Mullvad has never had any problems with any part of their company/services. They're one of the only VPNs to have proof they don't log anything (aka Court Proven). They allow Port Forwarding. They offer a completely anonymous sign up as well which is a big plus for some. The speeds are just as fast as any of the others. 

And the reason you see companies like Nord, Express, etc being praised online is because those are all just paid testimonials, they pay those sites to write highly of them. (I assume that's where you mainly have seen it. Sites like pcmag, tomsguides, etc) whereas mullvad does not and thus, doesn't get the same spotlight.


It just comes down to the fact mullvad checks all the boxes and doesn't really have a single red flag against their service unlike basically every other VPN available so there's no reason not to use them"
Mullvad,Can you in layman's terms explain to me what port forwarding is and why I should use it?
Mullvad,"Mullvad has electrolytes.

No, but, seriously, just go with the cheapest Wireguard .conf provider you can find that isn't too fishy."
Mullvad,"Mullvad is a favorite here for it's anonymous factor, above average speeds, and port forwarding making it a great VPN. 

There are a few reasons not to buy it.

1) Mulvpn has a pricing model of only \~$5.72 USD (or 5 Euro), but has no Commitment Pricing so you can't buy a Year at a Discounted Price. In One Year, I will Pay \~$68.59.

Torguard w/ a 1-Year Coupon Code, a Year will cost $30 USD for a Year.

That's a 129% Increase in Price so Mulvlad is by no means the cheapest.

2) The Speeds are above Average, but not the best. If going purely for Speed, WeVPN, Torguard and Hide Me. Note that you will notice the difference in speed between Mullvad and these three VPNs if using Fiber Optics, but for the Average VPN User their all fine."
Mullvad,I guess I did see that thread but I see the same things for Nord so I guess I just didn't understand their differences
Mullvad,"The easiest way is to read through this. If you scroll down to the bottom of the page after reading about Mullvad, it lists many articles why most of the others are bad and can't be trusted including Nord and Windscribe.

"
Mullvad,"I understand the criteria that is used to select VPNs and I appreciate the lengths people go for privacy.

I do wonder though.... This sub is called VPNtorrents. If one purely needs a VPN to stop pirating notices coming through your door, are the selection criteria slightly over the top for a normal torrent user?

No judgement, just a genuine question!"
Mullvad,"I have been a NordVPN customer for several years. Overall I have been happy with Nord. They have many servers, a Kill Switch, and generally a good reputation. The hack, of course, put a dent in their reputation. After looking at the reviews of Mullvad I would probably subscribe to it if I were looking for a VPN today. Unfortunately, I have a year left on my Nord subscription so I will have to stick with that for now."

Torguard and Tomspark,"Is tomspark to be trusted? Im think of buying torguard with three year deal so i can get it for 90$. I know it is based in the US, but it doesnt really matter, does it? The vpn i have seen a lot good talk about is Mullvad, but that is based in the 14 eyes too, and imo they would 100% start logging user if goverment were to ask."
Torguard and Tomspark,"The eyes crap is irrelevant for the torrenting threat model. That said, Mullvad wipes the floor with Torguard in basically every aspect, except long-term pricing which you may want to think twice about. This is a better deal for them than for you, and consequently we get people here every week regretting they were locked in a multi-year subscription.

Torguard is popular among YouTubers and some websites because they have a generous affiliate program, so they cash in everytime someone signs-up with their code. Conversely, Mullvad lacks affiliates so every recommendation is from a happy user. 

If you want more VPN recommendations, [check this thread](

Lastly, keep in mind Torguard doesn't have a clean track record: "
Torguard and Tomspark,"I think his intentions are good but, in this community we look for VPN's that are specifically geared toward torrenting. Spark on the other hand looks at VPN's that are good in several aspects.

For example, for torrenting Mullvad is king. No question. However, if you want to use streaming services, it's not. Point is, you need to know what you want your VPN to be good at, do the research, and decide for yourself.

If you want a Jack of all trades master of none VPN then Torguard would be a decent option. Which is why I think he pushes Torguard so much."
Torguard and Tomspark,Tom sparks is a known TorGuard shill. Mullvad is a much better service than TorGuard.
Torguard and Tomspark,Don't buy a vpn plan for more than a year (ask people who bought nordvpn or surfshark for 2+ years) They could always turn their back against you (Ipvanish) or they could always sell out (PIA)
Torguard and Tomspark,"I used Torguard and they were ok. Years ago their website looks like a 5 year old designed it, but it looks better now."
Torguard and Tomspark,"Hey thanks for watching my videos!

Lots of people here are biased agaisnt things like Mullvad and iVPN. They are certainly good VPNs too, deserving of A tier rank! However, iVPN is one of the most expensive VPNs, and Mullvad has weaknesses too (but you won't hear people admitting them here). 

But as others have said, TorGuard and my other top rated S tier VPNs do things these VPNs do and OTHERs as well.

TorGuard is 100% clean in the reputation department. The only dirt people can find on it is competitors like shitty [VPN.AC]( claiming torguard copied a ui extension 10 years ago without any proof.

If you value complete transparency, and stuff like that, [Hide.me]( wipes the floor agaisnt iVPN and Mullvad--because it also has streaming compatibility, more apps, and it was THE first VPN to be publicly audited in 2015.

WeVPN is the new kid on the block, and you can find more info about it in my reviews!

If you want the best VPN for the best price, TG is king. It's cheaper than other options, includes socks5, port forwarding, and has the best speeds."

IP Leak," 

I was using the NordVPN client app with kill switch enabled but I’m pretty sure a glitch happened and my IP leaked (because I got an email from my ISP).

I searched for a solution and found out I was supposed to route qbitorrent through the VPN ethernet connection under “network interface” on qbittorrent. I also turned on anonymous mode and forced encryption. This is entirely my fault for not having it set up this way years ago.

I’m a noob when it comes to networking stuff so I might not fully understand what I’m talking about. From my understanding, even if the VPN client “glitches out” or the kill switch fails, my connection can’t leak because the torrenting software has nowhere to send the data.

Is this enough to prevent IP/DNS leaks for the qbittorrent software? Is there something else I should do like make a VPN Raspberry Pi to “double VPN” my connection?"
IP Leak,Binding the client to the VPN adapter alone is enough.
IP Leak,Yup just enable the kill switch and bind it like the previous comment. That is plenty
IP Leak,"> my connection can’t leak because the torrenting software has nowhere to send the data.

Correct!

> Is this enough to prevent IP/DNS leaks for the qbittorrent software?

IP address yes, DNS no. Your only point of contact (other than VPN's DNS) is your ISP. In the worst case, tracker domain requests will go to your ISP. They're not the ones who send notices but may still interfere by blocking websites via DNS.

Again: the ISP doesn't care about your DNS requests or what you do. It's the copyright trolls who see your IP online and send notices. *However* if you wanted to hide all DNS traffic from your ISP too: either use DNS-over-HTTPS (available in latest Windows 11) or dnscrypt: [guide]("
IP Leak,"I get DMCAs even with the kill switch, interface adapter, anonymous mode, Advanced protocols, no-logging DNS, and Brazil connection with Vypr

No idea how to avoid it, even when I check every setting+ip.leak.com, I still get DMCAs from comcast.

When i download from rarbg.to, I get .parts files because I deselect some of the options. These trash files aren't trackers, are they...?

IPv6 and Port Forwarding -- is it required?,"Given how plentiful IPv6 addresses are, I assume that most VPNs are assigning Unique Global IPv6 addresses to their customers when they connect to their servers.

And, since NAT therefore isn't required, do we have to bother with port-forwarding for IPv6?

P.S.: I can't detect any speed difference between IPv4 with or without port-forwarding. What explains this? I've heard that torrenting clients and protocols have built-in methods to escape NAT/closed-ports by using PeX and torrent tracking servers. Is that true?"
IPv6 and Port Forwarding -- is it required?,"A lot to unpack here. 

- Most VPNs either do not support or have IPv6 disabled by default. If you enable it, IPv6 addresses will also likely be shared unless you have dedicated IP addon or something. 

- Port-forwarding works with IPv6 but again, some VPNs will require you to specify it. I think AirVPN is such an example, while Mullvad applies the port-forwarding to both IPv4 and IPv6.

- Torrent clients do have NAT-PMP / UPnP that acts as port-forwarding *but this only works without VPN*. As soon as you connect, you cannot initialize connections unless the VPN supports port-forwarding.

- PeX / DHT isn't on the same bag as NAT-PMP / UPnP, it's to obtain more seeders/peers. Actually, having port-forwarding is useful for hitting these swarms. 

- If you don't notice difference between port-forwarding and without, it's because your use case masks the impact. If you only hit and run popular torrents, especially on private trackers, then you likely won't see a difference."
IPv6 and Port Forwarding -- is it required?,"I have no information whether users are each assigned unique or persistent IPv6 addresses.

> And, since NAT therefore isn't required, do we have to bother with port-forwarding for IPv6?

Depends on server's connection and forwarding settings (i.e. firewall). Theoretically: yes, most regular peers have great IPv6 connectivity thanks to this, unlike IPv4

> P.S.: I can't detect any speed difference between IPv4 with or without port-forwarding.

How many peers are in your swarms you're downloading from? Are there many incoming connetcions or mostly outgoing?

> have built-in methods to escape NAT/closed-ports by using PeX and torrent tracking servers

No the best they can do is UPnP if supported and Bittorrent's own hole-punching using a third peer. Sometimes it works then you practically don't need manual port-forwarding and with some setups it doesnt."
IPv6 and Port Forwarding -- is it required?,Best thing you can do is just disable IPv6 on your system and router entirely. There's no need for it.

Edit: Rewording"
Seeding is slow with port forwarding enabled,"Confirm that port is open for example on Mullvad's port check. If it is, check that you're using WireGuard or OpenVPN UDP. If all checks out, then it's likely torrent-specific, ie. just too many seeders and few peers. This is common in private trackers with seedboxes."
Seeding is slow with port forwarding enabled,IMO: the port forwarding recommendation is not based on reality. There's many ways peers can establish connections without port forwarding.
Seeding is slow with port forwarding enabled,"May not be the VPN. I Recently tested Mullvad, port forwarded it and get similar speeds (slightly lower) SURPRISINGLY than Nord. Really it's the closest one so far in terms of speed I've tested.

Is your Upload speed the same as Download? If you have cable, your upload speeds are only a fraction of your download speeds. Using a VPN further cuts this. Also MiB and KiB are greatly different than Mb and Kb respectively. The torrent client I believe reads in MiB and KiB.

Have you tried other VPNs that were faster? The only info I saw was You have a port forwarding VPN (same one as me) and it's slow. Therefore a lot of information is missing to help us help you."

FINES in Germany,"Hello everyone,
So I am soon moving to Germany from a country with no Copyright Law so I usually download cracked Adobe stuff and the casual movie from time to time without even thinking about it but a family friend just got a hefty fine just for opening a streaming website that uses torrents(not so tech savy but this website allows you to watch from torrent sources without downloading) my question is what's the way that guarantees I don't get fined because I am sure I'll be needing to torrent stuff.
Is there a vpn that guarantees that or should I find a vps and what are your recommendations for vpn /vps"
FINES in Germany,"You should use VPN in Germany yes. 

[Here's a list of recommendations]("
FINES in Germany,Get MullvadVPN its safe
FINES in Germany,Also look to guides for using vpn so that you don't leak your ip
FINES in Germany,"[Just GET A VPN: An economic calculation](

The fine is surprising, it means they're monitoring WebTorrent now too - I assume that's what the website used. It's pretty new as a technology.

*If you will stick to torrenting and my configuration guides, you'll be 100% safe.* I cannot guarantee your browser 'safety' because it's hard to get bullet-proof and avoid all possible leaks. In short: stick to old torrents, don't watch in browser. There have been too many accounts lately about VPNs not holding up as it should as far as general browsing is concerned.

PS: There're very few VPN clients that attempt to fully block the network when the connection drops"
FINES in Germany,You should definitely use a VPN in germany. If you get caught with illegal torrents you can get in a lot of trouble. With fines and letters up to €1000

Which Windows 10 clients FULLY support an integrated socks5 proxy ;,`qbittorrent` and `picotorrent` both work just fine with a SOCKS5 proxy.
Do I need open ports and port forwarding to torrent fast,I use Nord VPN binded to qbitorrent on macOS. I’ve heard people saying that you should have open ports on your router while you torrent so you can be more discoverable and so your performance will improve. Is this true. I’ve also heard that you need port forwarding on your VPN but Nord doesn’t have port forwarding. So my question is will having open ports and port forwarding help my performance while torrenting. I would like to get mullvad but I can’t switch because I have a two year subscription nord.
Do I need open ports and port forwarding to torrent fast,"There's only one use case where it doesn't make a difference: downloading from private trackers where most seeders are seedboxes and you won't need to seed.

In every other case it makes a significant difference. Last time I did a benchmark the VPN without port forwarding didn't even resolve the magnet by the time a VPN with port forwarding finished the download.

For seeding you can also expect to transfer 10x more GB during same time period.

I have used both, and honestly can't go back to a VPN without it. It is that significant."
Do I need open ports and port forwarding to torrent fast,"If you only download most popular stuff with over 100 peers, you'll hardly notice a difference.

If there're only 10 peers, downloads will start faster if your counterparts have port-forwarding.

If there's only one seeder and that person is in the same situation as you without port-forwarding, you'll never connect for the download. That's the TLDR."
Do I need open ports and port forwarding to torrent fast,"There is no reason to open/forward ports from your router.  They would not be used in a VPN setup.  If your VPN provider supports forwarding on their end, then you would have them forward a port for you.  This port is only used for traffic entering through the VPN tunnel on their side, not traffic entering through your main connection."
Do I need open ports and port forwarding to torrent fast,"I don't think you ""need"" to, really. Both down and up speed is fine for me, personally. Maybe seeding is better with open ports, but I get to 1,00 ratio really fast without it. And download speed would most definitely not improve for me either. It probably also depends on the torrent, but in my case it's useless. Mullvad user."
Do I need open ports and port forwarding to torrent fast,"For better performance, & to increase your ability to connect to all peers in torrent swarms, yes you do want to subscribe to a VPN with port forwarding support.

In your case the question is irrelevant since your VPN provider does not have port forwarding support, there's nothing you can do about that until you switch to another VPN provider.

> I’ve heard people saying that you should have open ports on your router

**Do not** do this if you are using a VPN on your computer/laptop, opening ports on the router is only for people without a VPN. When you have a VPN all the port forwarding needs to happen within the VPN connection itself."
Do I need open ports and port forwarding to torrent fast,"Fk yeah man greatness awaits!

Also Ivacy supports it and sometimes you can snag a lifetime membership on Mashable"
Do I need open ports and port forwarding to torrent fast,I prefer SOCKS5 and get awesome speeds without port issues.
Do I need open ports and port forwarding to torrent fast,I personally just point traffic through port 443. This has worked without issue because port 443 is always open and always within the VPN tunnel. 443 is the port for HTTPS traffic
"Run own VPN service from a country where torrenting is not penalized, and use it somewhere else?","My friends have some spare PC and laptops laying around in a different country I live in and getting a fine for torrenting is unheard of.

SurfShark - Always route the packets to Singapore when detected p2p(torrent) traffics,"G'day all.

I noticed that SurfShark will route the traffics to nearest server that p2p traffic is allowed. For example, I am connected to one of the sever in the AU. If there is no p2p traffics the connection will always stay in the AU region (by checking its exit IP location). However as soon as p2p traffic (says downloading a Ubuntu server iso torrrent) is launched, the VPN connection is routed to the nearest server which is Singapore in my case. (The OpenVPN is not disconnected/restarted).

I wonder if they have changed their policy recently.

&#x200B;

Any taker?  


  
\*\* I did contact the SurfShark support - and as usual, the support didn't help - they just follow the scripts and none of the it actually answered my question. "
SurfShark - Always route the packets to Singapore when detected p2p(torrent) traffics,"It is possible they reroute the traffic on their servers after they detect it (traffic inspection?) Try to connect to the Singapore servers and see if you get the same exit IP and measure ping times: When directly connected to singapore / when connected to AU and triggered reroute

Also run tracert to see if traffic rerouting is visible there."

[

The docker image actually does include everything I need. It's not qBittorent but it definitly does the job for me. I kind of like the added option of using docker envoirnment variables to configure / override settings in the container. Makes it easy to keep my config in one place."

Torrents won't seed,"I'm using qbittorrent through nordVPN, the downloads are fine but it won't upload?

I've attached my connection settings - tried some online guides but didnt work

Any fixes?

"
Torrents won't seed,Well for starters those torrents have low amount of peers. Then you're also using a NordVPN which is crap for torrenting. [If you want to seed (and download faster) you'll need a better VPN that supports port-forwarding](
Torrents won't seed,Try a torrent that actually should get some upload. You have basically 0 people downloading those torrents.
Torrents won't seed,First of all you are using nordvpn which doesn't have port forwarding so upload speedd will always be slow. Second of all you are using a socks proxy and seeding torrents is not supported on socks. I suggest you to either get a vpn that has port forwarding (don't use a socks proxy) or get a r/seedboxes for better upload speeds.
Torrents won't seed,"

And your post was a good example to refer to in [this post]("
Torrents won't seed,You'll never see the uploading as it only gather bits and pieces from you as it goes along. The only time you'll see it seeding is when you're the one actually hosting a/the torrent.
Huge download speed fluctuations & near zero uploading (qBittorrent v4.3.9)," I was having huge problems with downloading and uploading files about a week ago. Someone recommended that I downgrade back to v4.3.9 after having trouble with v.4.4.0 which worked like a charm... for about 2 hours which was downloading about 20-30 MiB/s but it's back super slow download with the minimal upload if any. I pay for something like 300MB DL and 50MB UL, using a VPN as well. Just can't seem to figure out why this keeps happening. Screenshot linked to show fluctuations, could my ISP be throttling me or something along those lines? 

"
Huge download speed fluctuations & near zero uploading (qBittorrent v4.3.9),"Hm. Perhaps any new app running interference on the SSD? New drivers? Or Wi-Fi board / router overheating and causing these performance fluctuations?

You need to conduct more tests to narrow it down, for example:

1. Resetting qBittorrent / trying another torrent client 

2. Trying another device on same network

3. Trying ethernet instead of Wi-Fi 

4. Trying downloading to external storage rather than SSD

5. Stopping all running apps/services in background 

6. Running speed tests to see if it also happens outside torrenting

and so on"
Huge download speed fluctuations & near zero uploading (qBittorrent v4.3.9),"99 percent of the time it’s your disk just not being able to handle the simultaneous rights. Some cheap SSDs are fucking awful for writes and reads at the same time. Check tools and “View Statistics” 

Take a look at your write cache overload. If it’s anything above 0.00% then you have a disk that can’t keep up. Either get another disk and setup a RAID 0. 

Samsung is usually the best. I have a single Samsung 1TB SSD capable of downloading 20 torrents at 1Gbit sustained."
Huge download speed fluctuations & near zero uploading (qBittorrent v4.3.9),"UPDATE:  
I rebooted my laptop this morning things and restarted everything and everything was running full power about 20 MiB/s no problems but then just a few hours ago it started acting up again. Now it just spikes to about 20 MiB/s overall DL then drops all the way to a few KiB/s and repetitively does that. This is super odd because it was just working fine a few hours ago. I usually just let the laptop do its thing so I'm not physically using it. I also don't think my network is getting any more taxed than usual either. Lost for what it could be, to be honest."
Huge download speed fluctuations & near zero uploading (qBittorrent v4.3.9),"It's impossible for me to believe this is caused by poor SSD performance. This barely looks like awful flash drive performance too.

If there're enough peers like over 30 then it's probably ISP throttling. I'd explain away your reboot fixes as luck and coincidence.

Beware of RISEUPVPN!!,"Correction: I didnt download stuff with this VPN, I couldnt use it without a donation, so I deinstalliated this software immediatly. 

&#x200B;

I definetly got a virus from this VPN. I have downloaded it via browser and it doesnt really work as they promoted it without donating.

Also after deinstalliation I always got a pop-up at the beginning that I should consider donating to Riseup-VPN. After a while my computer got heavily affected and I got Bluescreen error after using the Laptop for few seconds. At this time I couldnt find remaining data from Riseup VPN on the settings.

The Virus didn't allow me to reset it was really heavy! There was always the claim that there were problems resetting to work mode which is not normal!

When I pressed Control Tab on the windows common line, the phrase ""Vpn.Toast.png"" popped up!! ( I know those are Windows Icons but It doesnt appear anymore) There were also some exe. data with weird names when I searched for something unusual.

Thanks to TRON from Reddit and doing litereally everything to get rid of the Blue Screen error on the Internet ( I dont think that helped at all) I was able to reset my Laptop to factory mode and now I am free I guess.

Please beware of this VPN because Virus scans dont detect it and it goes really deep into your Laptop! I couldnt even do anything on BIOS it also fucked something up there, half of the settings were enabled and didnt showed me everything! My CPU was also very weird looking.

Try changing protocol to OpenVPN on TCP port 443. See if it there's no speed decrease. If problem persists, try multi-hop / bridge with Shadowsocks and try again. In case Windscribe has no Shadowsocks, you can get 1 month of Mullvad for example.

In addition try rebooting router / resetting firmware. In case you have another router, I'd also suggest switching and retrying."

They know those IPs because as part of their security model they periodically enumerate the servers looking for new IPs to add.  If you ever see a 1x1 gif pixel dropped on a page in DevTools, thats these companies.

Here is an example if anyone is interested: "

Which one is the cheapest and best vpn?,"I have read and seen many different vpns

And thought about getting mullvard!
But compared to all the other ones its pretty expensive

I wanted to get 2 or 3 years
But mullvard only has 1 year subscription....

Which one do you recommend guys? 
Im student with not a lot of money so as cheap and good as possible."
Which one is the cheapest and best vpn?,"There's people here every week disappointed that they purchased a 2-3 years cheap subscription and ended up locked because their VPN was compromised, went down in performance or discontinued their favorite server/feature.

Mullvad ethical pricing is actually one of its greatest strengths. They don't overcharge the monthly fee and allow you to keep it flexible. You also get 10% discount on bitcoin payment.

That said, if it's really that expensive for you, check out cryptostorm or AirVPN. But they're not as beginner-friendly as Mullvad."
Which one is the cheapest and best vpn?,"[NordVPN]( is very budget friendly, and it's probably the best one out there too."
Which one is the cheapest and best vpn?,Don't go with cheap that's for sure
Which one is the cheapest and best vpn?,"I use AirVPN. Works great. Has port forwarding.

They show €2.75 a month on a 3 year subscription. I got it for about €2.50."
Which one is the cheapest and best vpn?,I sebd cash every 6 months to mullvad and I think that's completely fine.
Which one is the cheapest and best vpn?,Mullvad also allows to pay monthly and strictly by the month. The yet untested best free one is DewVPN.
Which one is the cheapest and best vpn?,There are many $2-3/month plans. I recommend you find those and sieve through them to find the best one for your needs.
Which one is the cheapest and best vpn?,Surfshark is an affordable and secure VPN. It offers 81% discount on its 2-year plan.

Forgot to turn on VPN for an hour,"You'll find out within a month.

The worse that's going to happen is a DMCA warning email delivered by your ISP.


Use and bind qBittorrent to your VPN. This stops all torrent traffic if your VPN drops it's connection or you don't connect.

In qBittorrent, go to Settings > Advanced > Network interface and select your VPN interface.

If you don't know which is your VPN, disconnect it and see which interface."

Forgot to turn on VPN for an hour,this is why you have your vpn stuff on a machine that can \*ONLY\* get to the internet via the VPN. You test and make sure its not possible for it to access the internet from your clear connection and only works if the vpn is up. I recommend configuring this at the router level so as no machine/ os/ app setting can counter it.

Forgot to turn on VPN for an hour,"If you haven't received an email in a couple of hours to a day after torrenting, you're probably safe. It depends on the ISP, but they usually have it automated these days when they receive a notice (which they'll pass down to you).

Got hit with DMCA claims despite using VPN.,"I use Surfshark and qbittorrent

I got hit a DMCA claim a month ago, even though I used a VPN while I was torrenting. I assumed this had to do with the website I was using (YTS) as those were the only ones that claimed.

But, I just got hit again despite using RARBG and also having my VPN on.

According to SurfSharks website the VPN works fine and there are no IPS or DNS leaks.

But clearly it’s not working. What do I do?

Edit: Thanks for the answers everyone!

Honestly I’m so inept at tech stuff, and apparently to get a better VPN is kind of out of my price-range. So I think I’m gonna take a long break from torrenting.

It is weird to me that I never got DMCA claims before last year. I’ve been torrenting since I was 14 and nothing ever came up until late 2020."
Got hit with DMCA claims despite using VPN.,"Did you bind the VPN interface with the torrent client? If not, there's your answer (leak). Bind it.

Choose a better VPN while you're at it, Surfshark is crap for torrents."
Got hit with DMCA claims despite using VPN.,You didn't bind. That's cardinal rule one.
Got hit with DMCA claims despite using VPN.,"SurfShark disconnects/reconnects frequently. I used it for 2 years.

​Bind qBit to your VPN. This stops all torrent traffic if your VPN drops it's connection.

In qBittorrent, go to Settings > Advanced > Network interface and select your VPN interface.

If you don't know which is your VPN, disconnect it and see which interface disappears."
Got hit with DMCA claims despite using VPN.,"You most likely made one of these small mistakes.

*1 Never have the torrent program start with Windows.

*2 Always have the VPN on before the torrent program

*3 Always turn the torrent program off before the VPN.

*4.Check the Task Manager to be sure the torrent app is
   off before turning off the VPN."
Got hit with DMCA claims despite using VPN.,Switched from surfshark to mullvad and it's been working great and faster. Mullvad also has split tunneling if that's something you need.
Got hit with DMCA claims despite using VPN.,May I suggest you switch to Windscribe it's a smaller company but in the last three years of me using them I have not received one notice and it has it's own killswitch meaning if Windscribe loses it's connection it automatically blocks all internet traffic and the support Torrents and as a bonus they are really good at blocking ads

Student with no access to discord/multiplayer games,"As the title suggests, I am living in private student accomodation and I am unable to use discord/Facebook etc to make calls(only teams work) and unable to access any multiplayer game. As I'm living in Belgium but come from France/UK this is making me feel particularly cut off from friends and family.  

I assume a VPN would be the best solution to try and bypass this, any recommendations on which would be the best?"
Student with no access to discord/multiplayer games,"Yes, a VPN should help but it will depend on how advanced the firewall is. 

Try this:

1.	Buy Mullvad for 1 month - 5€
2.	Try WireGuard protocol, if it works great.
3.	If not, try OpenVPN TCP 443.
4.	If still not working, enable bridge mode (Shadowsocks multi-hop).

If you tried all of this and still can't bypass the firewall, then:

5.	Buy Cryptostorm for 1 week - $1.86
6.	Try obfuscating traffic with a SSH tunnel:  
7.	If not working, then HTTPS:  
8.	If still not working, try obfs4:  

At this stage you're dealing with GFW level of blocking, so you'll need to look into DIY v2ray server and hide it behind Cloudflare. But the most likely is that you'll solve your problem at (2).

P.S. Enabling DoH/DoT on your browser for DNS requests might also do the trick. If so but you need a system wide solution then look into dnscrypt-proxy "
Student with no access to discord/multiplayer games,"Oh wow thank you guys, I will try these things and let you know how it goes x"
Student with no access to discord/multiplayer games,"[Winscribe free version]( would be a good way to test the system. See if a VPN is going to fix it for you.

Mulvad is a VPN a lot of people like. It's €5 a month.

I use AirVPN. You can get 3 months for €15. Less per month if you pay for more time up front."
Torrent trailing off?,"Hi, was told to come here from r/torrents. I've got a problem and I don't really know enough about how it all works to fix it. I have a torrent currently at ~86%, which it got to at around a few mB/s yesterday, my torrent download speed never gets above 5mB/s anyway so I was happy with that. Then, yesterday evening and overnight it has dropped to less than 1kB/s. I've refreshed the trackers, tried switching my VPN server to a different location, nothing seems to be getting it back up. This isn't the first time I've had this problem either.

The only difference is that I had added two other torrents. When I added them, the speed dropped and I assumed it was because it was sharing the bandwidth, but after they finished it never climbed back up again. Now they're seeing and so aren't taking any download speed. How can I get the other torrent back up again?

Yes, I'm using uTorrent. Yes, I know. As soon as this torrent is done I'm switch to another. I tried switching to qbit midtorrent but it was just not picking up on the part completed one, it was trying to make a new one in a new folder so gave up and went back to u, for now."
Torrent trailing off?,"If the torrent has enough seeders, then it's likely because you're not using a VPN with port-forwarding enabled. What's your VPN?"

"Speed, Security, and Cost","Looking for some advice from you all that are smarter than me on if my current method for torrenting could do with a few steps being eliminated for maybe some faster downloads, saved money, or perhaps both. The way I currently operate is:

1. Fire up a VPN connection (Paid)
2. Browse for content
3. Magnet link desired content to a Seedbox (Paid)
4. Wait for files to download to Seedbox
5. Download files from remote Seedbox to local drive (w/VPN still connected)
6. Once local downloads are complete, close all above applications prior to disconnecting VPN

Any advice or input on if any of the above steps could be skipped or changed? Specifically concerning the Seedbox; I pay $5 even each month. Is this overkill? Is staying connected to VPN while downloading from the Seedbox necessary?"
"Speed, Security, and Cost","You don't need a VPN to browse torrent sites (unless they're blocked by your ISP)

You don't need a VPN to download from your seedbox (use SFTP or FTPS)

Your seedbox will most likely come with its own VPN configuration should you need to use it."
"Speed, Security, and Cost","I don't think using your VPN while downloading from your seedbox is necessary. If you have a secure connection your ISP can't tell what you are transferring. Also, your ISP doesn't care. 🙂

You could look into Sonarr, Radarr and Prowlarr for media management and searching."

The choice to pick a trusted one is yours, I did not exclude anybody on any criteria.

IPv6 support is a *nice* thing to have but not mandatory: in rare cases you may connect to peers instantly via IPv6 but not IPv4. Most VPN providers don't advertise it readily and often refer to ""IPv6 leak protection"" - in other words, no IPv6 connectivity.

**All entries are sorted alphabetically**, but there're numbers to pick one at [random]( A lack of details means I couldn't find it without asking support directly. Your contribution in comments is welcome: corrections, requests to add a new VPN etc.

**Wireguard note:** There're legitimate privacy concerns about it. Without custom patches, it is impossible to be used without unintended ""logging"". Further, port-forwarding might only be possible when connected via OpenVPN. Please comment if Wireguard+Port-forwarding doesn't work with a VPN provider.

List of VPNs that allow port-forwarding (2022),"About Njalla (IPredator) VPN:

\- If you connect via OpenVPN, you will get a (random) public IP on the VPN interface

\- Since it is a public IP, you can do any port forwarding on it, just like what you do on your own router

\- Apparently you get a public IPv6 address as well...which means if your ISP doesn't provide IPv6, via the VPN you can perform native IPv6 routing

Note that my account was a migration from the old IPredator to Njalla so can't say it is definitely like that for new sign-ups."

Some you can trust more than others. At the end of the day, with a VPN you are only depending on someone’s word. No logs, completely privacy, and protecting you is not Law. The government and law enforcement has many means to coerce anyone. Financially, blackmailing, threatening, jail, or other means.

I don’t think anyone will stand up for somebody they don’t even know engaging in activity worthy of Law Enforcement attention. They will be thrown under the bus, Nord, PIA, Mullvad, IVPN or any of them. Not one will defend you if it means going to jail, being fined, or shutting down a business.

I think they are all pretty much the same. Be careful and don’t invest too much trust.

Mullvad blocks internet access,Ive gone through the guides on how to use mullvad with qbittorrent but for some reason mullvad will disconnect me from my network when im turning it on. Before trying that it worked. (Maybe its an Windows privacy location problem)

I picked a port and forwarded it through the Torguard website through both tcp and udp, and it seems like it worked, but when I use a port checker it consistently says it's closed. I also forwarded the port through my router and made sure qBittorrent, Torguard, and Wireguard were whitelisted in my firewall. What am I doing wrong?"

Help me Understand the Risks,"Hi everyone.

I have been reading a lot about this VPN stuff after getting a message from my ISP about quarantining. I obviously don’t want my service suspended and for the time being I still would like to torrent things. I know that nothing on the internet is actually private or can be made private unless u take active steps to mask ur online identity which is only rly necessary if u are trying to do some shady shit. 

I do understand that all VPN providers probably log even if they say they don’t but I wanted to get an understanding of why or why not VPNs are a fairly safe option for torrenting stuff and downloading Youtube videos. 

Thank you"
Help me Understand the Risks,"> I do understand that all VPN providers probably log even if they say the don’t

That’s why it’s important to pick a provider whose zero-logs policy has been audited by an outside agency. If you’re really paranoid, choose one that also allows you to pay in crypto.

>downloading Youtube videos

I don’t think this is that risky. It’s the torrenting that sometimes gets you letters."
Help me Understand the Risks,Yes you need a VPN. Depending on how much you download Privado and Windscribe both offer free versions with data caps. Stay away from completely “free” VPNs as they are the ones logging.
Help me Understand the Risks,"VPNs are a safe option because:

1. Early 2000s mentality wasn't completely washed out by copyright lobby's propaganda. It's morally OK to share information :)

2. Nobody cares because you are not turning $100M profit or damage (Interpol would like to interject then, no matter who or where you are) and because this is not a felony.

Remember VPNs are still businesses unless run by real activists. Not everyone would be ready to shutdown the business like Lavabit if Men In Black came knocking. Especially not those where [millions were paid for acquisition]("

Which VPN doesn't slow down the internet?,"You cannot get a VPN that has a 1:1 ratio of speed compared to your ISP. Routing your traffic through a middleman, rather than to your ISP directly, will always be slower. Now, depending on which location you choose in your VPN, that will affect speed and latency. I would say I get maybe 80% more or less of my maximum bandwidth on my VPN, Mullvad."

"Mullvad: Do I need to use the ""Always require VPN"" option when torrenting","I followed the [instructions for binding qBittorent to Mullvad]( Under the instructions, there's a subsection that says ""If you use the Mullvad desktop app then go to Settings > Advanced and enable ""Always require VPN"".

Ditto. I have the split tunneling filled up with excluded apps even when it's up. The VPNs seem to like pushing the notion that their apps should be used at all times. Helps them act like p2p isn't their primary market. :)

One thing to note about the split tunneling is that it still uses Mullvad's DNS choice rather than maintaining the prior DNS choice. I feel they should use your non-VPN IP \*and\* DNS."

We have a wiki - We will try to move/link the more informative posts there,"Nice initiative.

The link is broken though, I think it's case-sensitive.

For the future I'd recommend having a FAQ section (eg. why port-forwarding is useful). Another idea is to ""crowdfund"" the wiki contents, like opening a thread asking what are/were the most useful posts and resources.

As for the content some quick notes: there is a more recent list on VPNs with port-forwarding compiled by u/iqBuster; it'd also be better to use the VPN page of privacyguides.org rather than the no longer maintained privacytools.io and regarding the client binding page the links got lost when formatted to blockquotes. The TorrentFreak article also puts sponsors at first, so might not be such a neutral resource (as neither is ipleak.net or torguard torrent check, as both belong to VPNs).

Does binding a torrent client to a VPN network interface affect download/upload speeds?,"Just a quick question because I couldn't find answers online.

I tested it back and forth for a bit, and I was getting about 600-700KiB/s when bound to the interface, and about 900KiB/s - 1MiB/s when unbound. Not sure if binding really has an effect on speeds though."
Does binding a torrent client to a VPN network interface affect download/upload speeds?,"No. Your VPN connection is the same speed with or without qBittorrent bound to it.

Binding just guarantees that there is no torrent traffic outside of your VPN."

uTorrent + PIA Issue," 

I've been using uTorrent with PIA for years and everything worked well. Today all of my downloads seemed to be hanging (wont load file lists, wont connect to peers). I havent changed any settings and I'm not really savvy beyond knowing its smart to use a VPN when torrenting.

Does anyone have any advice on troubleshooting? Screenshot of uTorrent settings below. Thanks!

&#x200B;

"
uTorrent + PIA Issue,Is that port number the same as the PIA open port?
uTorrent + PIA Issue,"My personal recommendations: 

1. Do not use uTorrent. They have an awful history of adding malware/crypto miners to their application. Most people would recommend qBittorrent. 

2. Do not use PIA. Not only are they based in the US, but they are also owned by Kape Technologies, a company notorious for data mining. Being a US based company, PIA will give up your information and log files if someone such as the US government officially asks for them. Get a VPN outside of a five eyes country. 

3. You have a proxy enabled. I find that my torrents suffer when I use a proxy, as it is more difficult for peers to find you. 

4. Use a single port, do not randomize. Choose one port and stick with it. Set your program to that port, set your VPN to that port, and set up forwarding rules in your router for that port."
uTorrent + PIA Issue,"In my VPN I ask for port forwarding for a specific city. Yours may be handled differently. A number is chosen by them, and all the servers in that city have that port forwarded for me. That's the number that has to be entered where you've got 47619.

Nothing else needs to be done by me (other than binding the client). If I want to prove to myself that the port is up & running as needed there's a little extra. No router work needed, certainly. Some folks really disapprove of UPnP (which lets your router set itself up) but I've got tons of safeguards, thanks.

\[Binding the client: telling the torrent software to ever only use a certain-named internet connection. Different for each VPN. More reliable even than a killswitch. Easy in both utorrent & qBittorrent under the ""advanced"" secction.\]"
Surfshark why is only IKEv2 available as a network interface?,"So I am trying to set up my qbit so it only runs when my VPN is connected but qbit only seems to be able to use the IKEv2 network interface and none of the other ones like openVPN etc. I need to use openVPN(UDP) to use the bypass function in surfshark but that protocol won't work with qbit.

There's a lot of red flags, but out of all of these the one the sticks personally the most is the final one (review site changes).  A lot of the others could actually be explained fairly easy (even the intelligence/security links - as that's just Tel Aviv - its a huge industry there).

But, with the leadership change and rebrand the message was basically put out that they cleaned up their act (which to be fair they only made a delivery system not the malicious payloads).  With the review site changes it signaled to me that although the name changed the ethics did not."
What are the issues torrenting with ExpressVPN?,"I recently just terminated ExpressVPN after using them for years before they even got popular.

Copyright infrigement,"Here's a Guide I Written for TorGuard. Never got a Copyright Letter with and used it for years. Many here will suggest Mullvad because it's outside of the '5 Eyes' and has been audited and proven to be a good VPN.

Also to other posters feel free to edit, steal, suggest changes to my guide for reposting it to other threads if you like it. Basically follow the same steps with any VPN you use.

Also note, suggesting the VPN + SOCKS5 which is considered unnecessary from a technical standpoint. I use it because it makes me feel safer with that extra later that may or not matter and because of human error such as opening qBittorrent without the VPN on (which the Network Interface should stop anyways).

**In qBittorrent, make sure:**

Behavior:

Use a Dark Theme for qBittorrent so it doesn't annoy the eyes by going to Behavior then checking Use custom UI Theme, and download one off the internet such as darkstylesheet.qbtheme then adding it to the UI Theme file.

""Start qBitttorrent on Windows start up"" is disabled, this is so when your PC starts up, your IP incase qBitttorrent starts up before your VPN does, but I doubt it will because in a later step we combine the client to the VPN Network Interface.

Connection Tab:

Set Peer Connection Protocol to TCP if using Torguard, the VPN Provider suggest it for some reason.

Disable ""Use UPnP / NAT-PMP port forwarding from my router. This option does not work if using a VPN.

Set Proxy Server to SOCKS5, go to TorGuard SOCKS5 Proxy List (or the VPN your using), Copy/Past the IP into Host then use ports 1080, 1085 or 1090.

Check ""Use Proxy for peer connections"" this makes other peers see your proxy IP (If Using a VPN then they will see your VPN IP instead of Proxy, If only using SOCKS5, they will see your reap IP if unchecked!)

Uncheck ""Use proxy only for torrents"", This will make it use your Proxy IP for Everything.

Check ""Authentication"", for Torguard it's just your Regular Username/Password used for logging into Torguards Website, but for other VPNS could be other credentials.

BitTorrent:

Enable DHT to find more peers and Enable Peer Exchange to find more peers should stay checked if using a VPN, but Enable Local Peer Discovery to find more peers should be Unchecked because it does absolutely nothing if using a VPN.

The built-in qBittorrent Encryption mode is pathetically weak and should stay on ""Allow Encryption"" as all it does is drastically reduces the number of peers by only letting people connect with other people that allow Encryption or have it on.

Enable anonymous mode which hides clients fingerprint from the peer ID by setting the User Agent to Null while not sharing any IP with trackers (note peers still see proxy IPs).

Advanced: Make sure Network interface is set to wg-torguard. This is the most important step because it makes sure that not a byte of your normal IP gets leaked, only information going through the VPN will pass.

**In Torguard make sure:**

From the Torguard Program, you can put a Kill Switch on qBittorrent.exe. This will make qBittorrent exit out ASAP if VPN Connection is lost, but the Network interface should cover it.

The VPN's Encryption Tunnel Type Wireguard ( when choosing between OpenVPN, OpenConnect, and Wireguard) is the best as it's a fairly new encryption method designed to be more secure and faster. People seem to think the longer the encryption script, the more secure at the cost of speed, but it's a misconception. Wireguard uses very small scripts that are actually harder to decrypt with the use of cryptography.

**Other:**

Use ipleak website to test your VPN and not normal IP is showing and use the magnet link to make sure your proxy IP is showing. Also downloading Ubuntu is nice for testing out if your VPN/Socks5 security works right.

Some also use the Windows Firewall to make sure qBittorrent passes through the VPN or use a Router. Both options are overkill since the Network Interface Option in qBittorrent already does that."

Bind qBit to your VPN. This stops all torrent traffic if your VPN drops it's connection.

**In qBittorrent, make sure:**  
  
Behavior:   
  
Use a Dark Theme for qBittorrent so it doesn't annoy the eyes by going to Behavior then checking Use custom UI Theme, and download one off the internet such as darkstylesheet.qbtheme then adding it to the UI Theme file.  
  
 ""Start qBitttorrent on Windows start up"" is disabled, this is so when your PC starts up, your IP incase qBitttorrent starts up before your VPN does, but I doubt it will because in a later step we combine the client to the VPN Network Interface.  
  
  
Connection Tab:   
  
Set Peer Connection Protocol to TCP if using Torguard, the VPN Provider suggest it for some reason.  
  
Disable ""Use UPnP / NAT-PMP port forwarding from my router. This option does not work if using a VPN.  
  
Set Proxy Server to SOCKS5, go to TorGuard SOCKS5 Proxy List (or the VPN your using), Copy/Past the IP into Host then use ports 1080, 1085 or 1090.  
  
Check ""Use Proxy for peer connections"" this makes other peers see your proxy IP (If Using a VPN then they will see your VPN IP instead of Proxy, If only using SOCKS5, they will see your reap IP if unchecked!)  
  
Uncheck ""Use proxy only for torrents"", This will make it use your Proxy IP for Everything.  
  
Check ""Authentication"", for Torguard it's just your Regular Username/Password used for logging into Torguards Website, but for other VPNS could be other credentials.

Is a vetted vpn that's tied to a home network good enough to keep guests from getting me copyright notices even if a torrent client isn't binded to the VPN interface? More in comments,"I have a problem on my hands. My line of work means many employees stay at the job site and get to use the wifi. Is a VPN like mullvad, set up  directly to the source router plugged into the modern directly, enough to stop us from having copyright problems should one of them try to download a tracked movie? Would getting a router configured for vpn use help and if so, which one? If not, how do I protect myself in a manner where they can use the wifi but can't do some dumb shit causing us to lose our precious starlink up in the mountains? They don't necessarily need to have the option to download stuff but I'd be ok with it if it's secure. And from OPs post it seems like the only safe play is for every device to use a specific client program # programmed to port forward etc but I absolutely cannot rely on them to do that. We had over 100 employees come and go last year and expecting them to care is impossible. I just need a VPN that can handle 100-200mbps without lag issues, we mostly just stream movies etc anyways and need enough upload speed for 50+ cameras at 720p. Having a device like a router that is the final stop would be ideal I assume? Also maybe only having one free port for peer to peer while blocking the rest might work on a router?

You can even set up port-forwarding and tell employees the port number if they want better torrenting experience, but why bother - I think your main goal here should just be avoiding copyright notices, not facilitate piracy at work.

This way they won't need to bind.

The downside is that all traffic will go through the tunnel, so Netflix may have some content restrictions, you may get more CAPTCHAs, perhaps blacklisted from some websites, etc. But you won't get copyright notices."

Difference in IP addresses using ipleak vs other generic what's my IP sites,"TL;DR: when connected to PIA, ipleak shows a different public IP in a different city versus literally every other generic ""what's my ip"" website. Just curious if anyone else has seen that or knows why that may be?

More details below for those interested in the full story:

So I am pretty new to the home media server game, but I built a media machine around 8 months ago and have been using it with no issues. Details below:

* Windows 10
* using Plex, Sonar, Radar, qBittorrent, and Private Internet Access (PIA) for the VPN. All apps installed on the computer. Not using any type of container or docker application
* In PIA, I had the killswitch and advanced killswitch settings enabled as well as having PIA DNS set as the dns config. No split tunnel enabled.

for the past few months everything has been humming along just fine. I am definitely not a consumer of lots of content, but I've downloaded a fair number of movies and TV shows with no problems (roughly 30 movies and maybe 10 shows total). But, this morning I woke up to an email from my ISP about a movie I added through Radar last night. I was a little surprised because I haven't had any issues before now. I checked my machine and the VPN was active and I didn't see anything that stood out.

After browsing this sub, specifically the pinned post, I found some additional settings that I tweaked, such as binding qBittorrent to the VPN NIC. I'm hoping that corrects my issue, because before it was set to ""any nic"" or whatever the actual name of the setting is called.

After making those changes, I used the suggested sites in the pinned post to confirm I wasn't leaking any Public IP, DNS, or Torrent IP connections. All of the tests in the post, as well as using other generic IP detection and DNS leak sites show the same IP information, with the exception of [ipleak.net]( Ipleak shows completely different IPs for my machines IP, DNS IPs and Torrent IPs. The IPs ipleak shows is not my actual ISP IP, but also differs from my VPN IP. I'm probably being overly cautious because of the email from last night, but just curious if anyone else has seen a similar discrepancy when using ipleak?"
Difference in IP addresses using ipleak vs other generic what's my IP sites,"Are you connected to a virtual location server? PIA has some and differentiates them with a little globe near server name. You can also check this list but I don't know if it's updated: 

If I had to hazard a guess I'd say perhaps they're using a method that gets the physical location IP (and city) rather than the virtual one. I've heard this is possible but u/iqBuster and u/simplex0991 are the network pros around here and should be able to fact-check this or advance other explanations."
Difference in IP addresses using ipleak vs other generic what's my IP sites,"As they aren't your ISP's IP address assignment to you, do you mind sharing what the VPN IPs were shown as?  I don't use PIA, but the geo-located region thing makes sense.  

PIA did that because of Russia.  Russian law says a VPN provider has to provide them access to traffic.  They don't want to do that, so they can't really have a physical datacenter in region.  Instead, you purchase IP blocks that RIPE NCC has allocated to RU and route them elsewhere.  

Unless you're passing traffic through a different egress point on PIA's network, it shouldn't change.  That would be the simplest explanation."
Difference in IP addresses using ipleak vs other generic what's my IP sites,"Thanks u/daiqo

The most likely explanation: PIA reroutes HTTP/S traffic on their ""p2p-optimized"" servers elsewhere (ports 80, 443, 8080) while default traffic (including BT) exits directly from the server. A plausible reason for this: have *dirty* traffic use the tolerating provider, while HTTP traffic is rerouted elsewhere to avoid most blocks and banlists. This is a speculation that'd require thorough testing. PS: They have to do this for netflix already

Own IP and DNS IP will always differ. **DNS IP** in many cases shows client's approximate geographic region and reveals the ISP, since all ISPs have their own DNS resolvers and only few internet exchange access points per country, where the **DNS server is located**. Machine IP is obviously the IP that carried your traffic.

Though despite the above speculation it's a weird setup. IPLeak uses the tracker for detection and that's on HTTPS iirc. I can't say anything conclusive wihout lots of testing."
Copyright claim,Hey. New to torrenting and keep getting copyright notice emails from my isp. Does anybody know a way to torrent anonymously for free?
Copyright claim,"""If you aren't paying for the product, you are the product.""

Any free service is going to be sketchy, lackluster, or both. 

$5/month is a small price to pay for privacy and quality service, I would recommend that. Guides as well as service recommendations are in the sub stickies. 

Also, free services are unlikely to have the port forwarding options that are reliable, you're better off just paying rather than giving your info to a company that's going to sell it, or leak it, or both."

Atlas VPN Create additional Network adapter which prevent local network?,"I have been using Atlas VPN for a while (a Free version one)  just to browse some blocked site in my country like reddit here for example and has no problem so far.

I can't access my CCTV or other local PC on my network.

Is Warp sufficient? Given that I already pay for Norton, I would prefer to not pay for an additional VPN just for torrenting. I just want to make sure my ISP doesn't track my torrenting, and that my IP address isn't exposed."

Portforwarding from wireguard docker container to qbittorrent docker container,"Hi,

Im trying to port forward my torrent client, yet it wont work. My torrent client is running 24/7, and Im seeding a lot of ''almost dead'' torrent. So making this possible would keep the torrents more alive.

Portforwarding from wireguard docker container to qbittorrent docker container,"Why not use a combined qBittorrent / VPN  container?

That was my solution. 😁

I don't use Wireguard but [this one]( says it's compatible. It's the one I am using."
Portforwarding from wireguard docker container to qbittorrent docker container,"I don't think port forwarding is what you want here, at least not at the Docker level. You've specified that your torrent container uses your wireguard container as its network, which means that the two containers literally share the same network stack, so they're on the same IP address. (--net container:wireguard-client).

[

>Network: container  
>  
>With the network set to container a container will share the network stack of another container. The other container’s name must be provided in the format of --network container:<name|id>. Note that --add-host --hostname --dns --dns-search --dns-option and --mac-address are invalid in container netmode, and **--publish --publish-all --expose are also invalid in container netmode**.

You may be getting in your own way here. Opening an app like qbittorrent in this mode and setting it to listen on a port in it's container will also mean that it's automatically listening on the same port in the wireguard container, since they're sharing a network stack. Running \`lsof -i:5689\` from the Wireguard container should show that a process is listening on that port. Try disabling the port forwarding setup for 5689 in your docker config."

"Using external VM (ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Mullvad) in a completely virtual environment","I'm trying to setup a virtual instance in Google Cloud and would like to hide my outbound IP through a 3rd party VPN like ExpressVPN or NordVPN.

Is it possible to have a multi-VM environment where one serves as the VPN connection and the other executes scripts remotely.

Torrenting (seeding) with VPN that doesn't forward a port - misconceptions,"Many VPN providers that don't provide ""port forwarding"" say it's not necessary for torrenting/seeding. They cite security issues. So what do users who torrent do in these cases since my experience has been that I can't seed at all without a port forwarded by the VPN provider.

I was under the impression that I could bind my torrent client to the VPN tunnel interface (utun on mac) and Local VPN IP address, but  also open a port on my router and add that port in the torrent client to enable seeding. I guess that was a misconception, because when I do so - even though the torrent client says connections are possible - the speed is very slow.

I have been told that setup is not doing what I think it is. That the open port is not on the VPN network it's on my non - VPN WAN! Which means any traffic going through that port would be visible.

When using the forwarded port in qBT settings, qBT achieves up to 20MiB/s down speed.

When using an open port on my router in qBT settings (while bound to the VPN interface and IP) it achieves up to 2MiB/s down speed.

This is with all traffic going over PIA VPN tunnel and using PIA DNS servers. So there shouldn't be any ISP traffic shaping going on.

Also, when using the open port in my router, qBT is slow to pick up DHT nodes (less than 100 nodes). Whereas with the forwarded port DHT nodes populate (over 360 nodes) within a minute.

I am on Comcast, I know they are blocking torrent traffic. When not using a VPN I can't even seed a Linux Distro.

*I did cross post this in PIA and qBittorrent forums*"
Torrenting (seeding) with VPN that doesn't forward a port - misconceptions,"- Enabling port-forwarding on a VPN has nothing to do with router. 

- While torrenting you can either be an ""active"" or ""passive"" node (being able to initialize connections). Without VPN you're an active node if UPnP / NAT-PMP is enabled which usually is by default. When you connect to a VPN you become passive, unless you're port-forwarded (again - nothing to do with router).

- It's possible to download / upload as passive node (without port-forwarding), you just connect to fewer peers. Fewer peers means slower speeds/performance. This is especially noticeable while seeding or downloading from public trackers, and especially negligible while downloading from private trackers with plenty of seedboxes.

There you go a summary."
Torrenting (seeding) with VPN that doesn't forward a port - misconceptions,"If you are running through a VPN tunnel, then seeding is impacted without port forwarding as you are limited to connections initialized from your end only.  UPnP isn't going to work through a VPN so there is no automatic mapping possible from the far end.

Opening ports on your router shouldn't matter if you are bound to a VPN interface as traffic isn't hitting those ports on your router.  If PIA is forwarding port 9001 for example and you bind port 8001 (which you opened on your router in this example), then since the VPN interface is bound you would be using an un-forwarded port through the VPN which would impact speeds."
Torrenting (seeding) with VPN that doesn't forward a port - misconceptions,"> I could bind my torrent client to the VPN tunnel interface (utun on mac) and Local VPN IP address, but also open a port on my router and add that port in the torrent client to enable seeding. I guess that was a misconception, because when I do so - even though the torrent client says connections are possible - the speed is very slow.

If this is true, you already have a massive security breach.  Stop right here - the rest of your questions are irrelevant.  You first need to bind your client to the VPN.

&#x200B;

I repeat, bind your client to the VPN.  Do not proceed until you have done so.

&#x200B;

As for port forwarding, either side of the torrent (leeching or seeding) can have the open port - but one of them must, or the connection isn't possible.  You may not notice - a lot of users do, but not all.  PIA is now owned by an untrustworthy company, and should be avoided.  Find one that allows port forwarding (Mullvad is the community favorite, but by no means the only option) and switch to it."

Alternative to AirVPN who don't just use M247.,"I've been with AirVPN for a few years, and in the past year started to get more and more sites blocking access. Did narrow it down to be whenever using their UK servers which had M247 IPs, so got around it by only including their non M247 servers in the connection config. AirVPN have now switched the rest of their UK servers to being with M247, as a result I've noticed I now able about 20-30 exemptions configured in OPNsense to bypass the VPN for sites so that can use them which is increasingly making AirVPN pointless and unviable on a privacy standpoint if have to bypass using them all the time.

What other providers are there that have the port forwarding (and DDNS a bonus but not essential), and don't use M247 or IPs that are blocked by most popular UK sites?"
Alternative to AirVPN who don't just use M247.,"Mullvad has self-owned servers in UK and also rents from xtom. 

Besides that, CryptoStorm as /u/LG7114Follower mentioned. Or OVPN."
Alternative to AirVPN who don't just use M247.,"M247 is a hugely popular VPN egress provider. You can give CryptoStorm a shot - it uses iomart for its London location. Windscribe could also fit your use-case. In the UK, they have Digital Energy Technologies, Datapacket, and EstNOC besides M247. Good luck on your hunt!"
Alternative to AirVPN who don't just use M247.,"> I've noticed I now able about 20-30 exemptions configured

I know this isn't a fix but it has a potential to shift the mentality: **notify the admins of the websites**. Don't just work around it silently on your end. While normie providers have the budget and marketing depts to shift mainstream's perception of VPNs as privacy tools, we need to be pushing among techies the recognition of the VPN/Tor traffic. Your message probably won't have an immediate effect but it will add some gradient to the black-white thinking. I've had my account actually whitelisted before.

It probably will not help at all with big companies where your reports will end up in the first level support black hole.

I only know of Mullvad who provide a list of servers+backing network provider, they have 3 different for UK and of course the majority are M247. As is the case with AirVPN, you'd have to contact support manually to find out. Don't forget some admins are so crazy they blacklist any data center traffic."
Alternative to AirVPN who don't just use M247.,"Thanks for peoples suggestions. I tried Cryptostorm but no matter what couldn’t get any incoming packets over the VPN, and was the same with OpenVPN and Witeguard.

Does the Wireguard Port have to match the active port specified in qBittorrent?,"To answer your question no. If the port is still unreachable, make sure that: a) it's linked to the active WireGuard key (in the web dashboard); b) you're connected to the right city; c) qB is running when you test the port.

If you confirm all that and sitll doesn't work, check your firewall.

All those ""review"" websites you're looking at are paid ad placements. You can see yourself when you look at the links to the rated VPN providers, those links are referral/affiliate links. The ""review"" websites get paid to tell you to click those links & subscribe to those VPNs.

Nord in particular is well known for doing all sorts of paid advertising, whether it is ""review"" websites or people shilling Nord and spamming Reddit with their own referral/affiliate links.

[Beginner] Torrenting in Germany,"Hi everyone,

I was frequently torrenting stuff in my home country as they don't really care much about copyright laws. But I moved to Germany and have heard about the strict german laws regarding torrenting. So now I'm looking at the option of using VPN, particularly Mullvad to download. I also plan to follow instructions such as binding my torrent with the VPN, checking for leaks or something like that. My questions are:

* How safe am I when using VPN to torrent? Under which circumstances will my IP be found out resulting in me getting an Abmahnung?
* I'm staying in a shared house with the owner. They or their network provider have configured the internet, so that everytime a new device tries to connect to the internet (for example trying to access Google), it has to be approved by the owner before being able to surf. In that case will my IP still be exposed if I use a VPN?

Cheers and thanks for any help."
[Beginner] Torrenting in Germany,"1. Configure your client properly by following my guides and you will be safe: 
   * Bonus: don't use the servers from the same country
2. When you're using the VPN anybody in between will only see that you're exchanging lots of traffic with the VPN server.

Steps for you:

1. Choose a client. Basically qBittorrent or Tixati for desktop
2. Choose a trusted VPN
3. Connect to VPN, while the client is clean & empty configure the network binding
4. Setup dnscrypt-proxy so ISPs can't censor/see your domain lookups
5. Have fun"
[Beginner] Torrenting in Germany,"* You are safe when you do everything you said you do. Check for leaks, be extra careful. The only circumstances where your IP will be found out is when you have leaks or your VPN is not working despite having torrent traffic.

* The approval of a device for the router (this is what happens) has nothing to do with the VPN.

Also, torrenting will only get you into trouble if you have copyright holders in Germany which are protecting their property. Unfortunately, if you think that nobody has a copyright here and you are wrong, it costs you €2000 even if it is the first time if they get you."

I used [this]( guide to adjust the config file Mullvad provides, and set Deluge to bind to the WireGuard network adapter's IP. Since WireGuard protocol uses static internal IPs the binding will always work unless I download a new config from Mullvad's site that uses a different IP. This shouldn't be an issue in qBittorrent anyway, as you can bind to a network adapter directly instead of needing an IP.

I haven't had any issues with Deluge because it uses separate processes for the web interface and the actual torrent client, but I was using the same setup with qBittorrent for a while without any issues accessing its web interface. As far as I know, if your Caddyfile reverse proxy entry for qBittorrent's web interface is routed to a localhost:port address, it should work regardless of what adapter qBittorent is  bound to."

Is the ""free"" referring to something else or are there features that are only ever included in paid VPN services that are necessary to not get caught while torrenting? Would the free ProtonVPN plan not protect me from getting caught?"
"What does ""paid, not free"" VPN mean, exactly?","> For example, ProtonVPN offers many kinds of paid plans but also a free plan, which has limits

Well yes, one of the limits is that you can't torrent/p2p with the free plan. So your question is a bit irrelevant for /r/VPNTorrents .. maybe you meant to post in one of the other VPN subs for non-torrent VPNs?

Also see /r/ProtonVPN e.g.







etc."
"What does ""paid, not free"" VPN mean, exactly?","I'll keep the line of reasoning generic and avoid mentioning specific services since there are always exceptions.     
    
I'm sure you've heard the saying ""if you're not paying for the product, you are the product."" This is particularly true online where user data is valuable. When looking at any service, it's important to know how they make money. With an exclusively free VPN, the only way they can make money is by donations, tracking you, injecting ads, or selling the data that flows through their VPN. That's definitely not something you want when torrenting. 
    
With something like a tiered system, it's less likely that they need to sell data to pay their bills. The paid tier *might* cover it. It also might not. If it doesn't, a provider is more likely to sell data or do something less than desirable to monitize the free tier. With a paid VPN it's even less likely they would need to rely on these nafarious things to pay their bills. In fact, they'd likely drive users away from the service. Of course, that risk level is still never absolute based on just if it's free, tiered, or paid becuase the humans in charge can be greedy. Individual reputation still comes into play with both tiered VPN and fully paid ones."
"What does ""paid, not free"" VPN mean, exactly?",">Would the free ProtonVPN plan not protect me from getting caught?

Yes it would because you can't transfer torrents on the free account.

Yopu can achieve the same result by disconnecting your Internet. :)"
"What does ""paid, not free"" VPN mean, exactly?","On free plans, you are the product and your info. There's no guarantee that they don't log and will share with authorities. The only ""seemingly"" legit one is DewVPN but the best paid one is Mullvad in every way."
"What does ""paid, not free"" VPN mean, exactly?",It means you pay for the service you use and do not create an incentive for your VPN provider to monetize your data or something else to make up for it.
"What does ""paid, not free"" VPN mean, exactly?","Mainly because most free tiers won't let you torrent through them.

In general, the free tier of a paid VPN is usually fine, if they let you torrent to begin with. Free tiers are there to act as trials to show you what the provider has to offer.

There's also the subject of port forwarding, which you won't find in almost any free VPN, which means lower torrenting speeds due to less peers that you can connect to.

With VPNs that are just plain free, the kind like sshagan, freevpn.me, vpnbook etc they don't really have as much incentive to protect you if they do actually get pushed in a court case, and we don't really know what they do or don't log. Most people assume that this kind probably sell browsing data to advertisers which may or may not be an issue for you. Personally I've used those three a lot for torrenting in the past and never had an issue, but they can be slow or unavailable sometimes, and none of those 3 offer Wireguard.

IMO with free VPNs it depends on your use case. If you just want a glorified proxy so you can download stuff without your ISP sending you notices, then some of them are fine for that. But if you really need to hide something, are accessing your bank account, or are seeding heavily and making yourself a target, then you probably want a well-known premium provider with a good reputation who you know you can trust.

I wouldn't trust just any random free VPN from a Google search. Other free ones like Betternet etc, I would stay away, in particular I've seen some DNS shenanigans going on when I tried them. Some will also inject ads into your browsing among other shady stuff. I definitely wouldn't use the random spammy-looking no-name free VPN apps you find all over the Play Store for example."

Rarely they don't have subs and even rarely are they out of sync.

And after you figure out which groups don't do subs -- like `TBS` -- you can easily avoid them. Also using sites that show mediainfo is a good site to use, like RARBG.to.

Also good to have Addic7ed (TV), Subscene (Movies) and OpenSubtitles as a backup."

ftp is a real old protocol, but it would also work for this.

""external LAN device"" is an oxymoron unless you aren't using your own router or something crazy is going on. all clients on your LAN (local area network) are local. everyone outside of that is on the WAN. connections between LAN devices and the WAN are restricted, firewalled, and must go through your router, so will require limited access, specific protocol, or for you to configure the connection manually.

if you are torrenting from web source, using a torrent client, then you can share locally using a normal file/folder sharing service."
Torrenting Chinese private tracker from the U.S. - where to place the VPN server for best upload performance?,"I recently started torrenting a Chinese private tracker with torrenting friendly VPN (e.g. port forwarding works) from the U.S. However, while I get good downloading speed, I barely get much upload speed.

[GUIDE][VIDEO] Setting up port-forwarding on Mullvad,"Notes:

- When adding a port it's necessary to specify the WireGuard active key, you can check it in the client app right before clicking ""manage keys"" button. The city must match the server one you're connecting to (obviously).

- The port may take time to become reachable.

- Ignore the other qB settings shown, they're the default values. I also don't recommend Safari.

Is the uTorrent WebUI running through my vpn proxy?,"Hi folks, happy new year.

I have been torrenting manually for years  but I'm just getting started with some automation.  I currently have the uTorrent client running through my PIA proxy.  In setting up Sonarr, etc, I am enabling the uTorrent WebUI at localhost:8080. Is that traffic also going through the PIA proxy that I have set up in the client? Or is it sidestepping it somehow by going through a browser?

On a related note, should I be using 8080, or should I use a different port?

Thanks!

"Torrents over VPN start fast, then slow down significantly","I've tested this with both mullvad and PIA.

I have a gigabit connection. When starting a large torrent, the speed will shoot up to ~80-100 MBps no problem, stay there for a few seconds, and then plummet back down to the single digits, sometimes as low as 2 MBps. It'll stay there for the rest of the download, not speeding up.

I'm using wireguard with mullvad. I can confirm the server I'm connecting to is capable of gigabit speeds, so I'm not really sure what the issue is.

Connections status is green, so the port is properly forwarded. I also set the protocol to TCP only, but no luck with either TCP or TCP/uTP"
"Torrents over VPN start fast, then slow down significantly",Sounds like your disk is not being able to keep up. Your disk's write speed might be slower than your download speed. Play around with download buffers and caches. Good luck!

Alternatives to Mullvad,"Alright alright, before I get burned at the stake for this title, let me explain.

I've been a happy Mullvad customer for a long time now. I've had no complaints with the service and overall I'm very happy with it.

The problem comes into play when I try to use Mullvad with my NAS. Mullvad's OpenVPN passwords are only the letter ""m"" and for some reason, my TerraMaster NAS refuses to accept the letter m as an OpenVPN password. I don't know why my NAS should even have a say in what my VPN password is, but I guess that's just how it's going to be. So it's for this reason that I'd like to get a separate VPN just for my NAS, if possible. Or alternatively, is there any way I can make Mullvad work with it? If so, I would really rather use that than get a whole new VPN. Thanks!"
Alternatives to Mullvad,"Contact their support, they're fast to reply."

Alternatives to Mullvad,"Try using the account number as your username and password for your openvpn on NAS.

or actually try making a automated login file in your config folder, i think mullvad provides it in their zip if you download the openvpn files you will find a the ovpn files, config and a user/pass txt file.

You don't want a free VPN. They are collecting and selling your data because if the service is free, there's a reason. Especially with VPNs. I would highly recommend mullvad because it's cheap ($5 a month) and you can buy multiple months at once.

There are only 4 VPNs with both and a clean track record: Mullvad, CryptoStorm, OVPN and AirVPN. You can [read more about it here](

So that's a pass on Surfshark or others like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, etc. Actually yesterday there was a dude defending NordVPN and their great speeds who meanwhile deleted the comments [but one day earlier he was complaining about torrent speeds]( That's what happens when you use a VPN without port-forwarding.

no-log vpns/vpn suggestions,PandaVPN uses random digital numbers as your account. And they don't ask for your email address. This is the most log-free VPN I've ever seen.

Search better then, because it has been discussed ad nauseam. In fact it's one of the main points of a [recent post I made about recommended VPNs](

If you want strictly court-proven VPNs that are good for torrenting, there's only one: OVPN. If infrastructure audit is good enough, then there's Mullvad."
no-log vpns/vpn suggestions,Mullvad. That is your best option for torrenting.
no-log vpns/vpn suggestions,"Personally, my goto is ProtonVPN. A service put forth by the same company that created the ProtonMail secure email service."
no-log vpns/vpn suggestions,"Mullvad has been proven in court not to divulge info but that depends on how you pay them.

Mullvad vpn and payments,"If you use something like Mullvad vpn and you pay with paypal or Debit card like visa. How safe is this ? Can they track you down by your payment information?

I read something about the account not being linked to paypal, but instead a token. Does this mean they can't link your accounts activity to your paypal?

I do not understand much of this and even less of all the crypto stuff. So its basically paypal or not at all for me i think"
Mullvad vpn and payments,"You can send cash, I have done so and it worked a treat."
Mullvad vpn and payments,"I've been using Mullvad for a few years now. If privacy is a great concern, using PayPal or a credit/debit card to pay isn't a wise idea. While the VPN company itself will obviously accept your payment method of choice, the aforementioned methods do leave behind an electronic trail that can be tracked to you. The Mullvad payment would be easy to see on these payment histories. While it can be discovered that you paid for the service, actually knowing what internet activity happened is different entirely.

Mullvad identifies users by a unique token identifier. This is the singular way that the company identifies you. You use it to log in to both the app and the website. 

For the best security, you may consider paying for the service in Bitcoin. Though I don't blame you if that method is a bit complicated, but it provides the most security."

Surfshark and Qbittorrent Split Tunneling Setup Issue,"I've chosen to use Surfshark as my VPN of choice. I also use Qbittorrent.

I only want Qbittorrent traffic to use the VPN and the rest of my traffic to not use a VPN. Currently Qbittorrent is bound to only use the VPN network adapter so it'll only function if the VPN is on.

The internal split tunneling feature of Surfshark is not working after hours talking to their support folks, as such I'm looking for an alternative method.

Is there a way to use Surfshark's VPN for Qbittorrent only and the rest of my internet traffic bypass the VPN? Maybe with OpenVPN or some other script / program?"
Surfshark and Qbittorrent Split Tunneling Setup Issue,The alternative method that's best is not to use Surfshark. You get what you pay for
Surfshark and Qbittorrent Split Tunneling Setup Issue,"Yes, if you set up a docker container with a vpn and torrent"
Surfshark and Qbittorrent Split Tunneling Setup Issue,"I use [binhex/arch-qbittorrentvpn]( Docker container.

This runs qBittorrent in it's own virtual machine that doesn't interfere with your other Windows programs.

The VPN uses openVPN. You can find your openVPN config on the SurfShark web site.

Just a warning about SurfShark. You don't have port forwarding so seeding torrents is slow to nonexistant.

I used SurfShark for two years then they raised my subscription by >400% so be warned, there may be some bait and switch in your future.

They're split tunneling has never worked right. I assume your *support* was a lot of canned answers that didn't help."
Slow torrents with Surfshark,"Got 360/180 mbit fibre broadband. Speedtest shows exactly that. Downloading torrents without VPN speeds often easily reach 30-35 MB/s. Enabling Surfshark and connecting to geographically nearest servers drops my download speeds to 5-7MB/s (OpenVPN+TCP) or \~15MB/s (OpenVPN+UDP). It then fluctuates quite a bit and ends up substantially lower and wayyy more fluctuant than non-VPN.

&#x200B;

I do realize I can (or should) get a speed drop due to encryption and additional hops between servers, however I'm not sure if it's a different VPN would make a difference.

I tried some random servers and some were a bit better than others, but none reliable enough to sustain download speeds overtime.

(wired connection, enough seeders, etc)

Any thoughts ?

Thanks"
Slow torrents with Surfshark,"You're using OpenVPN without port-forwarding. Try a better VPN, one that supports WireGuard and port-forwarding which is precisely the main criteria in the [List of recommended VPNs (2022)]("
Slow torrents with Surfshark,If your connection is slow then it means you are probably using the wrong protocol. Make sure your protocol is set to Wireguard.
"Network interface of qBittorrent set to ""any"" with VPN on - any risk?","Hi.

If your VPN is on but the qBittorrent network interface is set to ""any"", is there a risk, or will qBittorrent automatically go through your VPN network?

Happened to see some other posts about this where people received notices with qBittorrent active and their VPN on. I just changed to qBittorrent today, but thought it was just a kill switch rather than completely necessary to get qBittorrent to go through your VPN connection as I assumed that would be automatic.

I tested with [ipleak.net]( and whether the network interface was set to ""any"" or ""nordlynx"", the torrent ip test for both seemed to be using my VPN's ip address.

I never previously had any problems with uTorrent, but want to make sure qBittorrent won't be less secure strictly in terms of isp detection.

Cheers for any info!"
"Network interface of qBittorrent set to ""any"" with VPN on - any risk?","Yes, a lot of risk. Network interface should be set to your VPN adapter only."
"Network interface of qBittorrent set to ""any"" with VPN on - any risk?","Turn vpn off 

If connections persist, it’s not set correctly"
"Network interface of qBittorrent set to ""any"" with VPN on - any risk?","somewhat. it is riskier. but that risk comes in if the VPN disconnects, if you aren't worried about the VPN disconnecting, but you still have internet, then no, there is no real risk.

&#x200B;

but I really wouldn't trust windows with that lol, or even linux for that matter unless I manually setup the routing myself."
"Network interface of qBittorrent set to ""any"" with VPN on - any risk?","I just set my Qbit ""network interface"" to my VPN. I also use a kill switch, but wanted a backup just in case.

How immediate is Qbittorrent's network interface? I downloaded a fully legal torrent and disconnected/turned-off my VPN. 

It did stop downloading, but kind of crawled to a stop over the course of 10 seconds or so. Is that real or or is it immediate and only looks like it took 10 seconds?"
Cheap 2-3$/month VPN for torrenting.,"Hello, I'm looking for the cheapest possible VPN that allows torrenting only for 1 month. I doesn't need to be supersafe, all I want from it is to hide my IP and not sell or leak my data. It's also important to have port forwarding and P2P unlocked.

I can pay max 2-3$ monthly. It can have some GB limits, but I need at least 50GB. I tried free version of Cryptostorm, buy it seems like they block P2P and also don't have port forwarding."

Do l need a VPN for direct downloads?,I use a site called 9anime and it allows me to download anime before I start do I need a VPN to do these downloads or can I do them without one. Thank you!
Do l need a VPN for direct downloads?,"No, you do not."
Do l need a VPN for direct downloads?,I would. If those websites log ip and than get confiscated you may get DMCA drama. For anime I'm not sure though.
Mullvad partners the same as having Mullvad?,"I noticed that Mullvad has partnered with Mozilla and Malwarebytes ""in order to utilize our global network of VPN servers for (thier) own VPN application(s)"".

So is that the same as using Mullvad? I'm thinking it's not but thought I'd ask the question.

If it's not the same then what's the advantage?

Thanks"
Mullvad partners the same as having Mullvad?,"Smart money is on the OG app, not a watered down version."
Mullvad partners the same as having Mullvad?,"Well, from the looks of it you need to signup with and email. Mullvad doesn't make you do this. They just have you generate an account number. Another things is it looks like they only accept credit card and paypal. So, you cannot pay with cryptocurrencies.

So, off the bat you can remain more anonymous with just the signup and you have more payment methods with Mullvad."
