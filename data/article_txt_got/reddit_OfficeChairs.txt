Mega chair thread #3,"Hi Chair seekers,

Welcome to the new Mega chair referral thread # 3 (which means we are in the 3rd year of chair advice since the pandemic started and people started working from home and started asking about it)

**Please, first, do a quick search on any topic in this sub and see if you question has been answered. (tldr, it has already)** 

If you would like to browse the [original post, look here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeChairs/comments/jcgnu8/start_here_the_rofficechairs_mega_task_chair/). Lots of good discussions 519 comments.  Also lots of good discussions on  [mega chair thread #2 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeChairs/comments/muppmf/start_here_the_official_rofficechairs_mega_task/)

my thoughts on [Head rests & foot rests](https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeChairs/comments/kv348t/headrest_and_leg_rest_on_office_chairs/) for example.

To summarize a little with some editorial spin here:  Steelcase Leap (V1 & V2) are probably the most asked about chairs on this sub, hands down.  You can sometimes find a good deal on local shopping sites. 

Ill will add Humanscale Freedom and Steelcase Gesture to [my list of office chairs](https://www.officefurniturenyc.com/chairs-we-love).

I am not personally a member of the Aeron club, but it is the most iconic piece of office furniture since the conference table and the item most people ask for by name, so there is often discussion of that chair here also.  

Other excellent chairs that often are frequently mentioned here:

Allsteel Acuity

Global G20

Haworth Fern

Haworth Zody

Haworth improv

Herman Miller Celle

Herman Miller Embody

Herman Miller Mira

Herman Miller Sayl

Steelcase Amia

Steelcase series 2

Steelcase Think

Knoll Generation

Knoll Life (meh)

Knoll RPM (ok, thats maybe just me, but still)

Examples of other great manufacturers: 9to5 Seating, AIS, Allseating, Keilhauer, OFS, Raynor, Sit On It & Via.

Who am I to give all this chair advice?  I am [Joshua](https://www.officefurniturenyc.com/joshua-bernstein) \-  just a used furniture dealer who's been trying out, buying and selling different ergonomic chairs for little over 15 years.  I am super biased towards the real corporate grade manufactures like u/Steelcase and Humanscale.  I am super skeptical of anything that comes RTA in a box for a few hundred bucks.  (Convincible, but skeptical)  I truly believe that your behavior is way way [more important than any one particular ergonomic office chair.](https://www.officefurniturenyc.com/more-important-than-any-one-office-chair).  I do not, as a rule, sell one-off chairs to individuals, (sometimes in Northern New Jersey but its not really how I make my livelihood so mostly I would give you another name if I can)

and now onto your questions:"
,"Thanks for all your help on this sub!

Question: outside of online reviews (Google, Yelp, Reddit, etc.) and of course being able to actually visit a store, how else can I assess how confident I can be in a retailer of used office chairs?

Here are two that I am considering purchasing from in the Chicago area:
[OFR](https://ofr-inc.com/)

[Office Furniture Center](https://www.officefurniturecenter.com/)

Any advice?"
,"I was able to get the Steelcase Think v2 with the mash back for like $250 today. I really want to get the head rest for it tho. Where would I be able to purchase the add on? I see it on bybluebox, but idk if that's a good site

,"Hey guys. I need your help. Best recommendations for 5‚Äú7 // 170cm - 130lbs // 60kg ? 

Use case: Gaming, Work and Relaxing like a lot of Movies, TV shows and just hanging out.. so basically everything. Will use it at least 12hrs a day sometimes even 16hrs. I sit in it all day. I slouch a lot too

It should be okay with different and also  awkward positions too. Not just straight up perfect posture. I slouch a lot too. It shouldnt creak a lot like my 50‚Ç¨ office chair :D

Price: around 500‚Ç¨ up to 1500‚Ç¨. A few recommendations that could work for me in terms of my criteria and size in both the 500‚Ç¨ and also 1000‚Ç¨+ price range would be awesome. Thanks in advance.

 Are these good for the mentioned use case ? Options i found that also look good aestatically:

Embody, Leap V2, Gesture, Amia, Zody, Soji"
,"Hello! I was hoping to get some recommendations! I'm 5ft 8in tall and 185 lbs. Originally, I was set on the Autonomous Ergochair Pro. It looked comfy and has a headrest and can tilt back. I did some searching on this sub and I guess these chairs are garbage. Glad I was able to find out before I spent money. I'm just gonna be gaming and doing school work on this chair so I won't be on it for more than 4 - 5 hours at a time."
,"Hello, I am looking for a chair that can go for 10-14 hours daily, 6,7 days a week. My current $300 dollar chair started squeaking after about a year. I am 6""1, 220 lbs. I have started developing some back problem, but it's not too bad right now. 

my sitting positions: 1. Sitting forward/not engaging lumber support (80% of the time)or 2. slouching to one side (mostly right side on armrest), or 3. lying on the chair, tilted back, fully engaged in headrest. I do feel that my current chair cushion is too hard, and pushing me to sit forward so I look forward to a much better chair with better cushion/lumbar support. I wouldn't mind a chair that engage me harder to force me to fix my posture. However I don't think I will enjoy a chair that hugs me. I do enjoy headrests but I am not picky about them. 

My biggest problem is my city have no showrooms, stores, etc. AFAIK I have no way to try the product before purchase so I really rely on online research. Budget can be as high as $1,000-$1,500. I've made the decision to invest in this for my health, considering how much I sit every day. Although if it is something that is super expensive I may wait around for a sale or promotion. 

I really appreciate you for doing this for the community. Thanks."
,"My wife has a Vitra T-Chair. I've put in some hours in that chair and can vouch for its quality and comfort. 

example: https://idealbuero.de/wp-content/uploads/vitra-t-chair-mit-breiten-streifen-versch-farben-schraeg-scaled.jpg

Vitra makes some other higher and lower end chairs, but the T-Chair is pretty much in the middle in terms of cost range. It has a pretty conventional seat cushion, but a long back that extends down behind the seat. Nice adjustable arms that go up and down as well as move in and out or at angles."
,"After major disappointments with all Steelcase chairs, the Aeron, Embody Logi, Carmel by RFM, and the Freedom, I went to Staples yesterday out of desperation. I sat in a Tempur Pedic TP6450. Immediately I thought, wait, is this *the* chair?!

Bought it for $450 (later realized it was $399 on [staples.com](https://staples.com), but oh well), took it home, assembled it, and I have been using it for about 2 hours now.

No neck or shoulder pain, and the seat pan is very comfortable (after all, it better be for a Tempur Pedic!), something all the other high end chairs caused me. 

Now I did have to remove the arm rests because they are way too high and get in the way. The lumbar is pretty aggressive but I have already gotten used to it. These are somethings that people may not like.

I HIGHLY recommend this chair!"
,"Ahhh. Backrest that can tilt forward of the 90 deg?

I will have to research that one."
,"hey there! I am willing to buy an office chair as I spent many hours to my desk, sometimes more than 10. My budget is tops 1.5k‚Ç¨, though, I live in greece (not athens) and the options are limited as I cannot test any chair easily apart from some herman miller ones and hamworth fern (all official vendors are in athens) .

I have found some through this thread and through other sources and this is my final list as of now:

1. Steelcase Gesture
2. Steelcase leap
3. hamworth fern
4. herman miller aeron (a bit more expensive in greece)

Any suggestions on these or others would be more than welcomeüôè

,"Hello,

[Steelcase Leap v2](https://a.co/d/50U9ZT2) is on sale for Prime Deals (S&S by Amazon) for just over $1050. I'm unable to try before, but I am able to buy.

I'm 5'7 130lbs, I'm constantly at my desk for work and play. Current cheap office chair from Amazon has been giving me lower back issues. I've remedied this with cushioned seats and lumbar pillows.

I'm looking to make an investment in my spinal health. Any reasons why I may not want this chair given my current situation?

For reference, I have an All Steel Acuity at work, which I really like.

Edit:

Currently looking at the [SteelCase Series 2](https://a.co/d/4bZkWWT). Thoughts?"
,Can anyone recommend the office star brand and their space model? How similar is it to the steelcase leap v2?
,"I'm after a new office chair as my current one is falling apart. I move around a lot when sitting and I think it's this that has torn all the material on the seat.

Now I'm working from home, and also use it for gaming, I'm willing to spend a bit more this time. I'm in the UK, so around ¬£500 would be great, but will pay a little more if it's worth it.

I'd prefer one with a headrest and good tilt."
,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve never had a decent office chair and am looking to make a big investment. 5‚Äù9, 170 lbs and all sorts of weird back issues from growing up a gamer. 

In short: I‚Äôm leaning towards an Aeron right now, but stumbled upon xchairs. I did a search and it sounds like they‚Äôre not really worth the money.. BUT

Does anyone have experience with the Elemax models that have built in air conditioning?

My WFH setup doesn‚Äôt have great climate control and built in cooling (and to a lesser extent heating) would easily be worth the price. 

Thoughts? Run away?"
,"My G20 chair has started to have a bit of oil leak from the cylinder after years of use.

Would it be a bad idea clean/wipe all the oil from the outside of t hat cylinder?

Would it make the cylinder less lubricated if that's a thing, or does having oil inside the cylinder only matter? Is it better to wipe off anything from the outside and there's no benefit from keeping that oil on the exterior?"
,What are some retailers that would have higher end office chairs in store to try?
,"Got a free Knoll Life with 4"" of loose back mesh, duct taped arm rests, stuttering gas cylinder, squeaky with movement, and yellow uv faded wheels. 

So far, I've steam cleaned it, wiped it down with detergent water mix followed by regular water, changed out the casters, pulled the mesh back with a picture hanging kit from dollar tree, greased gas cylinder, white Lithium grease applied to moving parts, pulled off the duct taped arm rest pads and cleaned with goo gone.

Next step would be to reupholster the arm rest padding with marine vinyl from Joanne's fabric shop since arm pad replacements go for $120+ online. Tried to find one from another manufacturer such as Haworth but the dimensions were slightly off although it's the same shape.

I also plan on sanding down the chrome base and arm rests, then polishing it. 

I must say, it's got really great lumbar support and adjustments, dare I say, better than the aeron chair I own. The gas cylinder was fixed with grease and the chair is much more quiet although it does creek if I shift all my weight to either arm rests or shift all the weight to the back.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."

,"Which Steelcase chair with a headrest will work best for short users?

I like the degree of adjustability with the Gesture, but I've seen complaints from short users that indicate it might not be a good fit. At 5'6"" I'm worried that the angle might be too aggressive, and it would press against the neck in the wrong place.

There are also general complaints about the Leap and Series 1 headrests, but mostly for the opposite reason, that they aren't far enough forward or supportive at all.

My main use for the headrest is to recline back fully and relax, not for extra support while tasking. 

Would any of thse work for me?

EDIT:

My main concern is that the Gesture headrest will push my head too far forward, as seen [here](https://youtu.be/7wG5UqCH_mY?t=842), especially when trying to fully recline and relax. 

I'm the same height as Dan Ahn in that video, so I imagine it would fit me similarly. It seems to be a problem not just for short users. None of the reviewers at BTOD are a fan of the Gesture headrest either, and they range from 5'8"" to 6'3"".

Is it likely to be uncomfortable if I want to kick back for extended periods? Is that even possible in the Gesture, or does the mechanism tend to put you back into a more upright position even as you lean back?

For anyone who has used the Gesture with a headrest, did you get used to it, or is it as bad as the reviews claim?"
,"In general would you guys recommend a high end but second hand chair, or a brand new chair but on more of a budget?  (e.g. from IKEA)"
,"I‚Äôm looking for a chair that the back pad can lean forward on. Weird request, but for video games I like to lean forward and wedge myself into the chair. Most chairs I‚Äôve seen advertise a minimum of 90 degrees, so I‚Äôve been using a wedge pillow strapped to the backrest but I‚Äôd like to upgrade. Do you know any that have this feature?"
,"I bought this chair from Costco on sale for $150 and after about 6 hours of sitting in I hate it. It's super underwhelming and not an improvement over my old Ikea Markus, which sucks for other reasons.

I can't seem to find anywhere that is selling refurbs or used Steelcase/Herman/?? in Canada. I'm not sure which brands even have stores or are carried in Alberta so that I could go try them in store. Can anyone share handy links or brand recommendations for someone that is 6'2"" and 230."
,"Well, finally fixed the back tilt on my Classic Aeron, and turns out that didn't alleviate any of the pain I've been having from it and possibly actually made it worse. So that's no dice on a Leap V2, no dice on an Aeron, and nobody within 50 miles of me has anything name-brand even in stock below MSRP... options are looking pretty dismal. Good luck to the folks who don't have major cities sucking up all of their used furniture market - hopefully you've got better odds than me."
,"hello guys, I am looking a chair that would fits bigger guys and I would love to hear your recommendations.

I am 190cm tall and around 130 kg. I am looking for a durable chair that would stand  daily 8h sitting and I like to lean back and forth but mostly I work upright.
I have a herniated disc on my back so lumbar support needed."
,"I'm currently in search of a replacement office chair. I have an autonomous ergochair+ and I'm starting to run into issues with my tailbone. Due to some medical issues have a bony ass (very skinny) and not much of a built in cushion.

  


I'm 6'4 and looking for something that will be more forgiving with the seat padding while still being ergonomic and durable enough to use over the course of a 10 hour shift.

  


Does such a chair exist? Bonus points if it doesn't have a hard edge on the front edge of the seat that puts pressure on the thighs. I was also hoping to buy second hand if at all possible."
,"Looking for recommendations  


Currently have an Amia (got 2 weeks ago) and previously had a Markus. The Amia isn't bad but outside of working, I did enjoy a good slouch and do miss the full back lean the Markus had (even if it wasn't super comfortable). I love the Amia cushion but want a little more comfort oriented chair rather then sit up right task chair.   


Been thinking the Leap v2 but open to suggestions. Side note, I did miss out on a CXO Nightingale for 250 like a week ago, still mad about that."
,Anyone got any good chair recommendations for someone with a  600$ budget?
,"I currently have a RH Logic 400. 

Keep getting an extremely tight groin, abs and hips whilst sitting in it. 

Would a mesh chair like the Cosm be better as it has harmonic tilt where the seat and backrest adjust to sitting compared to a lot of chairs on the market?"
,"Hello. I was wondering if you could suggest a chair for me with a very thick seat, lumbar support, head rest, and a mesh back that supports at least 280 pounds. Ideally one that can lean back a lot. I was thinking the btod akir but it's quite expensive (almost 1k Canadian all said and done for what is marketed as a budget chair) and certainly has the build quality of a cheaper chair. I was hoping for maybe a 500-600 dollar price point in cad but I'm willing to wiggle around with that and/ or buy used if need be. Thanks!"
,"Can I get a suggestion for a chair similar to the Haworth Zody? I really like the adjustable lumbar support and seat cushion. I have one in storage, but there‚Äôs no immediate access to the unit, so I‚Äôm buying a used chair on Marketplace until I can get to the storage unit in a few months."
,[removed]
,Does anyone have experience with Tempur-pedic chairs from Staples? I‚Äôm looking for a decent chair around 250-350 dollars. Any recommendations? I‚Äôve had no good luck buying chairs on Amazon.
,"Tried the Leap and the Gesture at a local showroom. I believe the width between the armrests on the Leap are 12.75""-20"" and the Gesture is 10.25""-22.5"". I've pretty broad shoulders and felt the max distance between the armrests for the Leap to be too narrow for me.

That said, I'm overweight and my arms aren't perfectly parallel to my torso, rather I'm comfortable when they are faced outwards a bit, widening the distance between where my arms would lie (if I'm not describing this well, I guess think of the legs/sides of a trapezoid). Would losing weight correct this issue, or is this even a posture issue at all? I feel like with the Leap I could make it work, but I'd be scrunching a bit. I'm using to a distnace of 21.5"" between armrests in my current office chair.

Reason I'm asking is because I liked both the Leap v2 and Gesture on first impressions, but I'm considering between a $569 Crandall Leap v2 vs a $1036 Gesture on Amazon. If I could save the money, I will, but I don't know if this one hindrance and minor incompatiblity is on me and something I can fix to make the Leap a better fit."
,"Thanks in advance any tips or suggestions help. 


I‚Äôve been searching for a drafting chair but no stores around me have them available to sit in and test out. Anything that can go above 23 ish inches since my desk is adjustable would work fine. I‚Äôm looking for something that has a bit of tilt and doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm falling out or leaning forward which is a MUST. I‚Äôm a bigger guy so in the past my chair‚Äôs seats have been on the bigger side."
,"Hi There. Looking for something very comfortable for my butt (my glutes). I find sitting long time begins to pain them. 
Also, I realize my cushions dont seem to last long on previous chairs and get flat and worn out I run into this problem quicker.
Any suggestions? I'm active and have bigger stronger leg/glutes muscles than average. Is this a contributing factor?

In my case does the cushion or mesh matter? I would imagine a durable comfortable cushion would be the best choice.

As far as back features the typical lower lumbar support but I'm way more focused on how comfortable my butt feels.


Any suggestions? Thanks."

,"Hey all I need some advice on getting a new chair. Thanks in advance.  


I was baited into the ""gamer chair"" craze a few years ago. I ended up with a Secret Labs Titan and it's on it's way the the chair afterlife. I have a permanent back injury and was looking into getting something with lumbar support. The style of chair I have now was already uncomfortable before the injury and has only gotten worse since then.  After looking at some responses here it seems like that even with no back injury some people who get chairs with added lumbar support actually get back pain from the chair itself.  


I have a budget of around 600$ and I'm 6""1 around 200 pounds. I live in a fairly rural area with no places to go and try actual chairs. Is there any information to go on to try and get close to ordering my dream chair on the first shot?"
,"Hi. I‚Äôm looking for a replacement to my Ikea MILLBERGET that is finally showing its age. I bought it off Offerup lightly used for like $60 and got a few solid years out of it. Armrests are peeling bad, the seat has started showing wear. A couple of months ago the armrests finally cracked, both had the same break so it‚Äôs likely the weakpoint of the plastic. I‚Äôve managed to reattach them with a metal plate, some screws, and epoxy along the inside of the break, but the fact still remains that I need a new chair. 

I went to IKEA because common sense dictates ‚ÄúHey, I like this chair. Just get another one.‚Äù Sadly, they had slightly updated the design of it and it was just barely tall enough to not be able to slide under my desk anymore. But the actual issues lie in the construction of the chair. The new one felt like it was leaning forward and actively dunking me out of the seat so I would have to be pushing against the ground just to sit right. The seat cushion also felt much lower quality and less padded, feels like a cheapening of manufacturing, as well as the chair clicking HARD when reclining at certain tension settings. Was not satisfied at all and returned it. 

My old seat is still holding on but I‚Äôm looking for a replacement that is similar in measurements.
No taller than 25‚Äù high armrests at the lowest seat height setting, no wider than 25.5‚Äù including armrests(desk has about 26‚Äù of width), and a roughly 20‚Äù inch seat with a high back. You can also look at the image of the dimensions for the MILLBERGET [here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/millberget-swivel-chair-murum-black-00489397/) but just take off a quarter inch from the armrest height. Yes it was literally that much that made the difference. The older design had flatter armrests.

Your recommendations are appreciated."
,"Hello folks! I'm fairly short (around 5'3"") but heavy (around 300 lbs). I suffer from chronic pain and definitely need lower back support of some kind; I also have terrible posture and feel uncomfortable sitting fully upright. Anyone around my size with some recommendations? I'm in Canada if that makes any difference, and I spend a long time sitting in part out of necessity and in part due to being a university student.

Assume for the sake of argument that my budget is unlimited; it's not, but I'm willing to shell out for the sake of a long-term chair."
,"So I‚Äôm split between a Haworth Zody for ‚Ç¨225, HM aeron classic full options with the wheel (so <2005) for ‚Ç¨350, HM classic newer (2010 ish) titanium without forward tilt for ‚Ç¨500ish or a remastered graphite for ‚Ç¨700. I really wonder if the prices of the HM are worth it?"
,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm currently looking at the Steelcase series 2. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù so my only concern with the chair would be the size of the backrest, since I‚Äôve heard it curves somewhat aggressively. Would this still be a good chair for someone with my height?"
,"So for 11 years of working from home, I had a needforspeed/maxinomic racing type chair, and the pleather is pealing like crazy now and it's all over my house...

,"I just started a new job, and because I'm the first hire that hasn't been a full work from home I'm having to order a bunch of things from Staples to get my work space in order. One is a a chair, as my chair was found to be broken on my first day, and all they had was a break room chair ready. I've been told I'm free to get whatever, but not to go too crazy (was basically told a $1000 Herman Miller would probably not clear). I'd say something under $400 would be best. Also, I am limited to Staples.

As for info about me, I'm 6 ft tall, and 250 lbs. I also have some minor back issues, so something with good lumbar support would be good."
,"Howdy chair experts, I'm looking into getting a steecase leap v1 or v2, I'm on the fence. I'm 5'10 and about 200lbs (trying to lose weight, you know how it is) are there any significant differences between the leap v1 and v2 besides the price? I'm also considering buying a refurbished/remanufactered chair, I've seen u/cranda58 quite alot on this sub and I have looked briefly in thier website, are there any other well know and reputable places that I should consider for remanufactered chairs? I simply don't have the budget for brand new right now.

Edit: I forgot to mention I do have a bad lower back, so looking for very good support, also I am still considering other chairs but the Leap v1 and v2 seem like my best options so far. I'm also nervous about buying a chair with no headrest, so I'd appreciate some insight into that. 

Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è"
,"6‚Äô4‚Äô‚Äô, 215lbs

Never really found a chair that is really made for my height, and even at my weight I‚Äôve flattened out the cushions in my previous ones. I ideally would like a La-z-boy on wheels, and I often like to sit with my legs curled or tucked under me so something with a deeper seat would be nice. But the main things I‚Äôd be concerned with are durability and something that fits my body size."

,"Hi all,

I'm predominantly a desk jockey, and at home I'm currently using a Steelcase Leap V2 I've had for a couple years. And honestly, I don't love it. My main issue is that the low back support feels like a piece of plastic just pressing into my low back. There's almost no cushion.

So, does anyone have any recommendations for what chairs I might look at? I was thinking about going and trying out the ICON Q2 and HON Ignition 2.0 at a place in my region. But I'd love recommendations for other specific chairs I should seek out to try.

5'11"", ~165lbs. In Canada."
,"Hiya, 

I was hoping to get a bit of assistance/advice.  I've been using a secretlab Titan gaming chair for the last 5 years and it seemed to be going OK.  However there was some damage to the bottom cushion so I just replaced it... and realized the reason why it was damaged is because the chair seat tilts backwards a small degree which forces my legs at an angle. It seems like i forcefully squashed the cushion down to get a 90 degree angle... That just doesn't seem right? And now I'm having instant back pain.


So I did some reading and decided I need to get an actual office chair. I'm WFH and probably spend at least 10 hours a day in the it.  I've checked some used furniture stores in my area (UK) and found some pretty good ones.


I'm 6 ft 1 inch, 210 lbs.


I found a local Herman Miller Aeron Size B in my local area for ¬£295.  This seems like a crazy price based on what I have been reading. I noticed you aren't the biggest fan but this seems like a great deal.


At a different store a bit farther out of my area is a much larger store but the sales team has to contact me for delivery. So I'm not sure if they will do a single chair.


From your list they have ...

Humanscale freedom ¬£165
Steelcase Think ¬£95 (but no arms so that worries me a bit)
Herman Miller Ambi ¬£ 95 (not on your list hut herman miller?)
Herman Miller Aeron ¬£ 900?? Why is the other one 299!

And quite a few others I don't recognize.


Appreciate any advice you might have!

Thank you."
,"Hello,I'm 180cm (5'11"") and 75kg (165 lbs) and I'm currently deciding between Leap v2 and Gesture. I have no prior experience of proper ergonomic chairs and I've been using a random gaming racer chair for the past 5 years. I have no problems with it but I've decided that it's time to upgrade. I mostly game, study or watch streams on my pc.

I love to tilt back and watch stuff from my pc so I feel like headrest is important for me. But that brings me to problem #1: I've heard that Leap v2 headrest is terrible and absolutely not worth the money. But then I've heard that Gestures seat cushion is way too thin and it makes your butt hurt which I'm scared of since I live in Finland and I have to order the chair from Germany. This makes returning the chair a bit more expensive.

I don't feel like the 4D armrests of Gesture are that important since I use them very rarely.

The site I've checked for the chairs with headrest on has Gesture for about 950‚Ç¨ and Leap v2 for 1300‚Ç¨. The huge price difference and importance of headrest for me has really made me lean towards the Gesture, any tips, pointers etc?

Thank you very much in advance.  


Edit: No option to try them out anywhere :/"

,"5' 5"" 120lb male with scoliosis

Looking for advice choosing a new used chair. I'm currently sitting in a [Steelcase 451](https://www.google.com/search?q=steelcase+451&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS970US971&sxsrf=ALiCzsZpAdFG88cKGaRcw4iRVD6i473O0w:1658029380718&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwio547igP_4AhWIl4kEHeBqAIsQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1920&bih=947&dpr=2) from a thrift store which looks cool and is nice for reclining with my feet up on the desk, but which is not nice for doing any kind of work. At work I use a Steelcase Criterion (that's about 20 years old, and also from a thrift store). I find it pretty comfy - the cushioning is perfect (I'm thin so I hate hard seats) and I find myself using the seat tilt quite a bit when I'm working.

It seems like seat tilt is not a popular option on chairs. Most of the used chairs near me don't have it. There's a used Steelcase Leap v2 nearby for $275 which I like the design of. Is it very different from the Criterion? It doesn't have seat tilt and the cushion is rather firm, correct? There are Criterion chairs near me for $150, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get over the design. I also see a really beat up Leap v2 for $50, a nicer one for $130, and a v1 for $225. Any other chairs to look out for?"

,"Hello! I‚Äôm a first time buyer looking for some advice. My current hand me down desk chair has been slowly falling apart and probably will not last much longer. I‚Äôve tried doing some research on my own, but the only thing I could work out is that gaming chairs are apparently a scam?

My use case is that I use that desk for work, gaming (both pc and console), as well as Netflix/YouTube etc. 

I like to sit cross legged, so I need the base to be wide enough to do that comfortably and for the arm rests to not get in the way. When watching stuff I like to recline back, my current chair can recline back but also lock itself to prevent reclining, I think I‚Äôd like something like that again. Have never had a headrest on a desk chair before so idk if I care about that or not. Is there ever a reason to not want one? Am also used to a high back which may be similar to having a headrest. Would be happy with another high backed one I think.

Also they need to sell in the UK. Budget is‚Ä¶ I have enough to get the top end chairs, but I was hoping to spend between maybe ¬£200-¬£500 but can spend more if I could be confident in the quality and comfort.

,"Hi everyone. I am struggling to find a chair that works for me in my budget. I don't want to spend much more than $600, since I only work from home 2 days a week. I also don't want a chair that is too tall as my home office is in my living room and it would block light from my window. I am 5'2"" and 130 pounds. I have chronic SI pain and hip pain. At work I sit in one of my office's conference chairs rather than the fancy office chair given to me with my desk because the fancier chair is clearly meant for someone taller than me. [This](https://ofs.com/products/seating/multi-use/acen) is the dinky conference chair that I can sit in for hours but it seemingly can't be bought individually.  I have tried the HM Sayl chair and liked it but it has a lead time of 9 weeks currently! I went to IKEA and for some reason liked the Langfjall despite it not being one of the more impressive looking options with any bells or whistles, but am not sure if I will like it long term. Also, when at HM the other day I loved the feel of the softpad management chair. Obviously out of my price range but I saw a knockoff called the Soho chair by Laura Davidson that would maybe work?

Anyway TLDR:

Under $600. Not too tall so it doesn't block window. Designed for smaller person. Able to get it relatively quickly. Thank you!"

Budget is around $700. Currently in the San Jose, CA area.

It seems like the most popular chairs are the Herman Miller Aeron and Steelcase Leap v2. Based on one of BTOD's great videos on both I think I'm more inclined toward the Leap as I like to move around a bit more in my chair and it seems the Aeron is more suited toward static placement. Of course, I'd be buying used or refurbished, not new.

I think I'd be more comfortable buying from well-known refurbishers than trying my luck with Craigslist, Offerup, FB, etc., especially for the warranty. I'm currently thinking of either BTOD or Crandall, but I'm also open to local dealers if they offer the same great warranty and service as these two sites. I found a thread from a year ago of someone buying a Leap from Crandall and upgrading to a newer base model for $100. I recently checked and the cost to upgrade is now $250... So that was a bit of a bummer. But, I've also heard of BTOD having very long shipping delays, and they don't have the option of a newer model, unlike Crandall. Also, Crandall offers a bit more cushion at 3/4'' foam while BTOD offers 1/2'', at least for the Leap. Certainly, both sites have their pros and cons and you can see how this leaves me unsure of who to go to. This is just talking about the Leap though, which I'm very inclined towards, but I'd be happy to hear about other chairs.

I'm going to wait to ""pull the trigger"" until Labor Day hoping for any discounts, so I have plenty of time to think about which chair I want and research more, but any suggestions or tips at all would be appreciated as I'm very new to shopping for high-quality chairs.

Thanks in advance, u/ibuyofficefurniture (and anyone else who wants to help)!

Edit to add: the two chairs I'm currently looking at are the Nouhaus Ergo3D Ergonomic Office Chair and the Branch Ergonomic Chair, but I'm also open to other options!"

 Is this realistic? What are some good options? I live in a big city, should I buy the chair secondhand?

,"Knoll regeneration from new? A really comfortale chair, it isn't that adjustable but I rate it alongside a steelcase Leap and Amia. 

I would investigate ebay and see what you can get shipped to you from there."
,"Amazon (EU, such as Spain, France, Germany) has some Steelcase Reply for around 500 shipped. You should still contact your local Steelcase/Haworth rep for options in that range on ""Task Chairs"" (the type of chairs you want for office work but also for ergonomic use in front of a computer at home).

If your local market has it, I can't also recommend enough to see what used/refurbished options are around. You used to find great deals but if they're not around you, it takes some convincing for the sellers to pack it up and ship to you. Good luck!"
Are there ergonomic executive chairs?,"I bought a chair from here once but it was not as comfortable as it looked.

https://www.hookerfurniture.com/home-office/desk-chairs/department-type.aspx

Want a big comfy chair that doesn't make my butt hurt."
,"The style may not be what you want - but Aeron chairs (by Herman Miller) are the go-to standard.   The ‚Äòmesh‚Äô is actually very supporting and comfortable.   The chairs are rock solid.   Their ‚Äòrocking‚Äô mechanism can be locked but the movement is not just to tilt - it kind of pivots and keeps the back support in place.   Fully adjustable.

It‚Äôs an ideal choice."
,"Studies show that most people can sit longer on semi-firm seats without before feeling discomfort than on highly cushioned seats. That's why the highest-end ergonomic office chair manufacturers don't even make such seats.

A few questions:

1. What exactly do you mean by ""executive chair""? Many ergonomic office chairs can come with leather upholstery and shiny metal frames and bases to make them look important (at a costly premium), but I haven't seen any with old-school armchair designs like the Hooker you used previously.

2. What's your budget, preferred and max? 

3. What are your height, weight, and any unusual bodily proportions? This info is vital for accurate chair fit."

New Chair Help - Slipped Disc/ Coccyx,"Hey everyone! Long time lurker, and I finally figured I'd reach out for some suggestions. 

I unfortunately was in a very bad car crash where I had to have my L5-S1 fixed.  The L5-S1 area is a weird area where most of the pain is while you sit/bend/pick stuff up while standing/walking actually helps with the compression.  This is where the tricky part comes in, I've tried a ton of chairs with no luck. Ultimately I've been utilizing my standing desk to help with the pain from sitting but a whole slew of other issues come from that.  

I've called Steelcase, Herman Miller, and even my physical therapist about this. After going through 2 aerons (B+C), Amia, and a gesture I am losing my mind.  After meeting with my physical therapist and an ergonomist they both suggested a coccyx pad but could not give me any suggestions. Before I buy one I wanted to ask the community if they had any combos? I still have my Ami and Gesture since I have to eventually send one back.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
,"Some office chairs brands sell chairs with seats with built-in coccyx cutouts.  I think this is the move because a separate coccyx cushion will inevitably shift around on the seat and affects the ergonomics of your chair (unless perhaps the backrest is height-adjustable).

Some brands that sell coccyx cutout seats include Office Master, RFM, Sitmatic, Neutral Posture, and Seating Inc. Office Master is the only one afaik that sells a seat with a ""hidden"" coccyx cutout, i.e. they hide the cutout with fabric so the seat looks normal.

Perhaps it makes sense to test a cheap coccyx cushion first to ensure it provides relief before springing for a new chair with a coccyx cutout seat."
,"I would also spend some time asking the medical professionals who are helping you out if there's anything they recommend.

Doctors or physical therapists have a different perspective when the body is injured then those of us on the sub who are looking at average/healthy average people."

Update: alright I fixed it. In case anyone from the future is reading this with a similar problem, I tied duct tape to the cylinder, and then rolled a long piece of that tape into itself (so it's like a rope) and pulled. That popped the seat assy right off"

Replacement parts or new chair,"I have a flexfit dexley frlm staples. The plastice base cracked and the chair is no longer usable and the old replacement ive been using failed tonight. Is there anywhere I can buy a replacement base or would I be better off with a new chair entirely. I really dont have alot of money for a chair and want to keep it under $500 but even with online reviews its so difficult to find a fitting chair that will be comfortable, breathable, and hold at least 300 pounds. (More than i weight but both chaird have failed to weight imbalances I think)"
,Have you tried asking for a replacement part under warranty?
$500 range. I know should get an office chair but tempted to get a gaming chair, I'm a remote game developer so Im sitting down infront of my computer most of the day. From what I've heard it's best to get a mesh office chair . But if have a pretty awesome looking computer and office set up and seeing something like a secret lab chair as part of it does look great. Do you think a gaming chair really underperforms enough for some one in my position to go for an office chair instead.

How important are the amia chair 4d armrest?,"Hi guys I (1.72, 92 kg) found a good deal (210 ¬£) for an used Amia (England) but it has the height adjustable armrests. 

Context: last year I was diagnosed with cubital tunnel, I'm a dev and this gave me a big scare. Since then I bought a split keyboard, a keyboard tray among other ergonomical devices. I recently learnt how to sit better. My problem is the lumbar support of my current chair is a bit awkward for my body so I get a stiff lower back after a full day of work.

In this context how important is it the 4d adjustable armrests? I think I could adapt to the width with the split keyboard and I have an average body.

I hope you are having a good day, posture and water check."
,Hard to say with out trying it in person. Some people dislike that the 4d arm caps don't lock in place. If you have back discomfort you should try before you buy if possible.
,"I love the 4D armrests, I adjust them to different places all day long as I switch positions or activities. But it's gonna be dependent on how you use the chair I guess. Could you buy them separately and add them?"
,"I personally like the 4D arms better on the Amia - the height only arms sit too far out for me. That said, if they are the correct width for you, and you don't like the sliding arm pad, they are a great arm.

Is the Human scale Liberty a trash chair?,"I have one at work and I hate it with a passion.  The backrest is just present enough to make you think it's useful, but so loose and hard to use that it feels like it is trying to get out of your way when you want to lean back.

Then the whole back of the chair is on a tilt mechanism that tries to push your butt out of the seat whenever you lean back.

Is this expected of high-end ergonomic chairs, or would something like a leap provide real back support?"
,"Yes! Absolutely! I have long held the all Humanscale chairs are garbage. They look nice but are horrible to sit in, expensive and like you say try to push you out of the seat. 

Knoll chairs are not very adjustable but soooo comfortable in comparison. Just because a chair isn't very adjustable doesn't make it trash but with Humanscale they are all just utter trash"

Is the firmness of the Aeron truly ‚Äúergonomic‚Äù?,"Been having some lower back pain and decided to pull the trigger on an Aeron remastered.

That said, every time I sit on it I‚Äôm surprised just how firm it feels. I know there‚Äôs an adjustment period and I‚Äôve seen enough good reviews & Aeron‚Äôs in offices to trust the process, but I still just find it surprising that this aspect of it would be ergonomic.

Steelcase Look alike - The Krost Archi - Any Info?,"Hi all,

Small rant, as one who can't explain anything in a mere sentence does.

So here in Australia finding a good price on a good chair that doesn't revolve around selling a kidney is pretty hard to come by. We either have really expensive AU$2k-4k+ for chairs like Herman Miller, Steelcase, Knoll, Haworth(Haworth are not as bad compared though- see below) or we have a heap of crap from names most probably haven't heard of with mark ups for you know, selling to us Aussies, because you know where else are we going to get it from. That and we don't have a massive market like USA or EU to keep prices down. (nor a second hand market to find those awesome bargains EU&USA can find)So with that being said I have been searching for a chair with arms and overall design like the Steelcase Gesture. I work and game at my pc a lot but I also play a guitar and piano and I have both those hobbies on either side of me in my small but well contained little room. Arms on a chair though, get in the way when I want to swivel around to pick up a guitar and start annoying the neighbours. I really like having arms for work and gaming, but unfortunately I can't justify spending $2k+ for a Gesture(saving for house as well), but I did find the below chair which, sure is less than half the price and sure only has 5year warranty, but it looks suspiciously like the chair I'd like to actually buy. But I can't find any reviews of the chair in question. Does anyone know anything about these chairs? Are they re-labelled chairs like so many of them are? Are there any chairs around with the same articulating arms like the Gesture has? Is this chair really worth it or are they banking on the design being so similar that people will go for the price and looks only to find a chair that simply doesn't even come close to the Steelcase version? Or, am I just over thinking it and I have found myself a bargain(at least for here in Australia)

Small side note, I can get a Haworth Fern from our Officeworks store here(they seem to be a reseller) for around AU$989(US$635), but only in black. Oh and yes, it doesn't have the arms I want but I do wonder if I could get those styles and attach them somehow?

Haworth Returns/customer service issues?,"I recently bought a fern with lumbar support and it is killing my back so I‚Äôm looking to return it and buy the fern without lumbar support. I always heard Haworth had great customer service and their return policy is on the of the reasons I purchased. 

I have had an awful time trying to return this. Over a week ago I reached out via chat and and got a follow up email about my return and then they ghosted me. I reached out several times about a return label and I get replies of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre looking into it‚Äù finally after 12 days I hop on chat again to ask what the deal is (I want to buy another chair but can‚Äôt until I get this refund)! They claim they are understaffed and ask for my patience. I‚Äôve worked in retail and e-commerce for years‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt take 2 weeks for somebody to process this. 

Has anyone else had this issue? My fear is they will drag this past the 30 day widow and I‚Äôll be SOL with a chair that breaks my back."
,Haworth has instructions for removing fern lumbar.  It doesn't appear to be the simplest procedure.
,"You made your return request within 30 days, they'd be crazy not to honor it."
,"That‚Äôs odd. They were amazing a few months ago. Just a heads up, not sure your height but the lumbar hurt me and the fern with no lumbar didn‚Äôt support my lower back at all. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and it seems like it would‚Äôve been fine for anyone 5‚Äô11‚Äù or taller."
,"I recently bought a fern and soji through their website and decided to return both close to the 30 day window.

I initiated the return on a Monday by emailing the store email listed on their site. They replied a few hours later:

""Thank you for letting us know that you wish to return your Fern chairs.¬† To assist you with the return, may we have the reason why you wish to return please?""

I explained my reasoning and got another reply the next morning (Tuesday) stating:

""We are sorry to hear that you are not happy with your order and prefer to return both chairs. We are processing your return request and upon completion, you will receive an email from our Resolutions Specialists. The email will contain a prepaid Fedex label, instructions on how to arrange pick up with Fedex, along with information about your refund. Please note, there may be a delay with their response due to staffing challenges and they will contact you asap.""

I got an email replying to the last one I received from Haworth Store Resolutions 6 days later (the following Monday) that included a pdf attachment with the fedex return labels.

I printed them and repackaged both chairs and filled out a return form on Fedex's website. They picked them up and were returned within a couple days and I got a refund the same day they were arrived.

Sorry your return experience isn't going as smoothly. I found their support to be very responsive and friendly for my return.

I really liked the fern, but didn't love the wool seat fabric or aluminum/shiny base. After returning the chairs I ordered another digital knit/oceanic flotsam (all black) version, which I'm expecting to arrive tomorrow.

They started a sale after my purchase, but before my new fern was shipped and I contacted support through their website chat about getting the additional discount. They said they could apply it, but I haven't seen any email follow ups or seen it applied to my credit card yet.

I screenshotted the chat and also sent the transcript to my email through the chat function so I'll either follow up again through chat or maybe just try emailing instead."

,Might want to consider the Leap plus given your stature. Would be wise to see if there's a showroom near you to give them both a test.
,"I'm gonna copy one of my old comments here, maybe its relevant to you. Also, I have a hunch the chair might be too small for you, you should definitely try it out before you look to purchase one. 

> 
> I got a remanufactured leap v2 from crandall recently. I think for the price, it's decent. But you have to be aware that you get what you pay for as well.
> 
> I use a leap v2 from steelcase at my office, so I got a leap v2 from Crandall to work from home as well. The chair I received from Crandall has significantly more seat wiggle / play when I move it back and forth along the seat depth compared to the chair in my office. It's something that I immediately notice whenever I shift around, and the sound of the seat movement hitting its limit is noticeable even with headphones on. I know this model is supposed to have some seat movement because of the way the plastic guides on the seat and the gliders you install are designed, but the difference is noticeable coming from a non-remanufactured chair.
> 
> So what I am getting at is, whether its because I got a beat up heavily used frame, or Crandall's non-OEM parts are not as snug as original Steelcase parts, your chair probably won't be like new. But at the end of the day it's a chair, not a spaceship, and it works fine - annoyances aside.

,"I'm the exact same height and weight as you and I've got a Leap V2 and it's perfect. I don't know if we have the same shape, but it's been the best chair ever for me. If you're concerned it's not a bad idea to go for a bigger size but mines been great."
,"I bought this exact same chair, and I have to say that ergonomic chairs are pretty overrated for gaming. They're designed to keep you in a good posture, which can be uncomfortable if you want to relax.

,"Hey everyone, posting in here again.

,"It's a similar design to the criterion. It's not that chair but similar back shape.

,Is your Leap new or refurbished/second hand?
,"The chair is dirty. The dirt is deep in the foam. The refurbisher only cleaned the very top layer of fabric. 

When you sit in it, you sweat. The water from your sweat travels through the fabric, then into the foam, and mixes with the dirt in the foam. When you get out the chair, the water evaporates, and as the water evaporates, it pulls the dirt out the foam and into the fabric where you can see it. 

This is called ""wicking"" in the carpet and upholstery cleaning industry. 

The way to solve wicking is to clean the actual foam underneath the fabric so there is no dirt to be disturbed and pulled to the surface."
,"Just got this refurbished Leap V2 on saturday. Sat in it for a day and had the white marks show all over the fabric. Used water and a cloth to wipe over last night and this morning had dried mostly fine and back to normal. However after sitting in it today, this is the result once again.

Need help in finding an office chair for home.,"As the title says, need help finding a comfortable, breathable office chair capable of keeping me comfortable for long sessions. 

Not looking to spend more than $600. Second hand market is available to me. Prefer one to have a headrest or a chair with a headrest attachment being available and adjustable arms. Id like to avoid leather and go with more breathable fabrics. 

I have been looking at some used Steelcase Series 1 and Gestures for reference. Also saw some haworth chairs I liked like the look of like the soji. Can‚Äôt really conclude what is quality or not since there are so many chairs on the market. 

A little side note - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 170lbs and 19 years old. Don‚Äôt really have back problems so i‚Äôm not in dire need for a chair that caters to that specifically. With that being said, comfort is my main desire - looking for anything I can sit on for hours and be fine.

Any and all suggestions are appreciated."
,"Imho, headrest are so overrated, good posture make an headhrest useless

For that price surely you can find something good in the used/refurbished market

My only advice is to try the chairs in person

Good luck"

Office chair suggestion in EU 800‚Ç¨ budget,"Hello all!

I decided to invest in a new office chair for my home office. I initially thought about a Zody, but my physiotherapist told me to avoid it, due to the back support being too high and limiting upper body movement.

There aren't showrooms near my place, so it's difficult to actually try different chairs. At my office we have the Sayl and it's okay but doesn't have quite all the features I'm looking for.

Requirements:

\- Highly adjustable lumbar support, both in position and ""strenght""

\- Need to leave me flexible to rotate my upper body to look at different screens

\- Seat that lets me comfortably tilt forward

\- Comfortable seat since I'll use the chair 8+ hours a day  and I'd also use it for gaming

&#x200B;

I'm 180cm (5.9ft) and weight 90kg (198lb).

Budget 800-1000‚Ç¨, can also wait for Black Friday offers.

Thanks for any suggestion! :)"

Steelcase Leap V2 sinking,"Hey guys, I've got a Steelcase Leap V2 and it's been awesome. Recently, I've had issues with the seat sinking when I sit on it. Now it is all the way down and won't go back on its own, I have to yank it up and even then it won't hold any weight. I took the seat off and saw that it's a side adjust cylinder. The little nub that the height adjustment lever pushes is loose and jiggly. Did I knock it loose or is my cylinder toast? Thanks in advance!"
,"Raise the chair to the correct height, then unscrew the height lever and pull it off. See what happens."
,Probably cylinder. The nub should be in line with handle.
,"Sounds like it could be a quick set screw adjustment - if the screw is loose, it may be worth putting some sticky tack on the end of an allen key to remove it and putting some blue loctite on it prior to re-installing.

,"Its the Steelcase Please V2, im sitting in the same one right now.

Have to mention its 10+ years old already, i makes a little noise when i lean back and the gas piston needs to be replaced as it wont got up anymore, but on a chair of that age i think its ok.

Completely down is hight enough for me.

&#x200B;

Pros:

\- Big chair, im 186cm, 120Kg, even lot bigger people would fit

\- Pretty stable construction, i often lay in it fully tilted back, sometimes legs on table

\- You can adjust the lumbar support height and how hard you want it to be

\- Armests have lots of adjustment possibilitys

\- Sitting pan can be adjusted back and forth, at least on my fully loaded one

\- Tilting can be adjusted in 3 steps, last one is pretty far back

&#x200B;

Cons:

\- Not your super soft and comfy chair, its a bit on the harder side, i find it ok but there are softer ones, i use a flat cushion on mine.

\- No headrest ( mine has one but i see room for improvement there ), if you wanna use it leaned back often maybe thats a negative for you

\- And my biggest gripe, the metal steelcase logo on the backrest, whoever came up with that needs to be bonked on the head.

If you wear thin clothes like a t-shirt and lean back a lot you will feel it, its hard and edgy, if you just lean back its ok, if you lay in it fully tilted back youll feel it."

,"Ask the dealer in your area.  Try sending a brief email only ask for pricing on a replacement series 1 seat include the fabric color code.

,"I agree, definitely a Mirra - not 100% sure on 1 or 2 without seeing the back, but it looks like these may have been through a lot based on some of the wear marks and the busted up arm I can see. Make sure to function check the chair prior to purchasing.

Humanscale Diffrient world- good used price and which version is more desirable? (U.K.),"Hi guys, looking for a decent used chair in the U.K. I work from home but have a standing desk so hopefully will only be using the chair less than half the time.

I have a budget of ¬£200, Aerons seem to be way out of this but there‚Äôs a guy nearby with 30+ Diffrient world chairs. they‚Äôre advertised at ¬£175 but I‚Äôm sure I could get one a bit lower. What would be considered a good price for a good condition one?

Also he has 2 versions, a black version with mesh back and material seat or a full mesh version in grey. Is either of these seen as more desirable for some reason?

Many thanks"
,"Humanscale chairs are high- but not top-quality; they're more likely to creak than comparably priced chairs. 

They're also love it or hate it due to Humanscale's hardline approach to ergonomics. Humanscale chairs essentially force you into an ideally ergonomic slight recline; there is no option to lock the backrest in a fully upright position.

If all this is okay with you, you're looking at what seem like fair prices for like new condition. I'd try for ¬£150 or less for any of those chairs with cosmetic damage, but ¬£175 is okay.

The fabric-on-foam seat is likely to last longer than the mesh, but Humanscale's mesh should be quality enough to last a good few years before sagging. Go with whichever you find more comfy, or the fabric seat if they both feel fine."
,"Humanscale chairs are all garbage, don't get one. They look nice but aren't comfortable and have no adjustability. For ¬£200 get yourself a used steelcase chair (leap, Amia) or a Herman Miller. Haworth Zody is very good too"
,It definitely looks very adjustable and for a heavier person. It might be.
,"Don't think it's the living, breathing type."
New or used Steelcase Amia?,Looking at one or two local preowned options for around $300 each or I could buy a new one for $680 from Amazon. I think either option is fully loaded. Is it worth half the price without any sort of warranty or just get a brand new one?
,"Steelcase chairs are really well made.  That's why u/steelcase is willing to write a 10 year warranty and why the most reputable refurbers will match the OEM warranty for a decade or more.  

(Even some  [not so reputable sellers of used furniture](https://www.officefurniturenyc.com/joshua-bernstein) would honor a long warranty on used Steelcase chairs because these things never seem to die.)

So if you are motivated by paying less then half the price of new, then get your bargin.  If you are motivated by new chair smell, get your new chair.  

And let us know how it all works out for you please."
,"Buy it used and if you don't like it, resell it."
,"Doesn't really matter, Amia's don't really break anyway. 

Out of hundreds of Amia's, I've only come across maybe 3 or 4 total that had some mechanical issues. They really don't break often enough to be worrying about warranties. They are nearly indestructible, and as a result, they are an easy recommendation."
,"Really depends on the condition of the used option - the Amia is a great chair and built very well, so I'm not really concerned about build quality on a used one, but you never know what a used chair has been though, so make sure to go over it closely and function test everything. I would say $300 seems a bit high for a outright used Amia with no warranty (Steelcase warranty does not transfer to a new owner, so unless the seller is offering a warranty, it will not come with one) or return policy unless it's in like-new condition. I don't think you can go wrong either way. Just my $0.02.

Thanks"

I've confirmed that it is covered by 9to5's 5-year @NCE warranty, despite being about $100 cheaper than the @NCE-216. A particularly good value because its backrest and lumbar support are independently height-adjustable, and it has nicely padded 3D-adjustable armrests.

Chair with most comfortable seating among reputable brands ?,"Hey, I'd like to acquire a good office chair for WFH. I went to a local chair dealer and could test HM Aeron, Embody, Hag Capisco and Futu ... but I'm not entirely convinced as I haven't found the seatings to be super comfortable in general.

I'm currently using a chair which is not even of office type (more like living room type), it's not adjustable at all but has plenty of cushion which I enjoy.  
Any advice on what brands or models I should be attempting to find and try out ? I'd have liked to test Steelcase models but it's not made easy by the fact there doesn't seem to be any dealers around my place. I may somehow go the extra mile to try them if they're really that good though."

I was thinking about Staples Union & Scale FlexFit‚Ñ¢ 1500TF. But I'm sure most here would recommend I try for a used Leap V2 or Aeron instead?

It's not been easy for me to find good deals in the UK, and I'm not too sure what websites are considered reliable (heard about some issues with 2ndhnd shutting down) 

If anyone's around my height, I'd really appreciate any advice on what chairs to get, and what you found the most comfortable. Thank you for reading."
,"Do some research and then go to a big local shop or warehouse that stocks the things on your list, and try them out. I didn‚Äôt do this because I‚Äôm lazy and impatient, but it‚Äôs obviously the best advice, especially if you‚Äôre smaller than average. 

Have a look at BTOD on YouTube. They‚Äôre actually a shop, but they do a  ton of comparisons, reviews and tier lists of all the best/ most popular chairs available in the states. They seem more like discerning, likeable nerds than salesmen, and are brutally honest about what they think is overrated or overpriced. 

So you‚Äôll get to see some more options, how adjustable they are, and how suitable they are for shorter users. 

They recommend the Amia over leap for comfort but it‚Äôs hard to find in the uk. 

In uk we also have European brands to choose from, but for some reason it was nearly impossible to find reviews on anything. This sub is massively US based and I couldn‚Äôt find any resources reviewing other brands.

I nearly bought a Vitra ID mesh as it seemed very ergonomic and looks nice for the bedroom, but then spontaneously snagged a Vitra AC5, mostly as it was a great deal (¬£225 including courier and VAT for a ¬£1300 chair including the optional ergonomic extras) ‚Ä¶but when it arrives I‚Äôll know whether it was a good choice or not, comfort wise! Should be easy to sell if not, and maybe even make a profit. They didn‚Äôt actually know the model name, so unlikely knew the value. 

But my point is, it‚Äôs fairly easy to get an expensive chair (used) within your budget, if you look beyond the Aeron which is iconic and holds a lot of value. Just familiarise yourself online or in person with plenty of options and then see what you can find used. 

I got mine from a site called ORS, and there are loads of these office furniture resale sites. Just factor in vat and delivery to the quote, and haggle a bit on the phone. They weren‚Äôt super knowledgable or the very best service to deal with, but they‚Äôre certainly legit and the chair is arriving tomorrow. 

Brand/ model wise, check out Orangebox, they‚Äôre super popular over here and owned by steelcase now. I was recommended their Do chair and was originally thinking of getting that. Super easy to find those cheap, and highly ergonomic. 

Was also considering one of the Humanscale Diffrient chairs, or one of the cheaper Herman millers, as Aeron seems pretty polarising for comfort anyway. Was also looking at Konig and Neurath Okay 2 or 3,  Knoll Generation and Haworth Zody. There‚Äôs pros and cons to all of them so you won‚Äôt get a definitive answer as to what‚Äôs ‚Äòbest.‚Äô 

https://corporatespec.com/

This site is a great resource for seeing what‚Äôs available, and although the prices seem higher than other office resale sites, they include taxes and delivery which can otherwise slap an extra 80 quid onto your invoice, and you‚Äôll also get great service and refurbishment. 

If you have the energy and want to risk it to save some extra bucks, try the other office resale places (who maybe just sell rather than expertly refurbish) like I did, and also look at Facebook marketplace, gumtree and eBay. Once you expand your options a bit, you‚Äôll find something"

Thoughts on the Steelcase Gesture (coming from a Leap V1),"Recently splurged for a new Steelcase Gesture with headrest after having used a Leap V1 for the last 5 years that I purchased off Craigslist (I think it was 200-300). The fabric was starting to really look distressed and was considering getting a replacement seat from Crandall or just getting a new chair. I make decent money and given the Leap I have was made in 2003, figured it made sense to just get a new one. Thought I'd share my impressions since I struggled with a new Gesture or another (new) Leap and read various things about some finding the Gesture uncomfortable.

I originally just used my Leap for gaming, but since COVID spent 8-9 hours on it per day. I've had teh Gesture about a month now and am still mostly WFH so have a fair bit of time in it.  Do keep in mind the Leap, had a manufacture date of 2003 and, to my knowledge, was never remanufactured. My assumption is it was from an office liquidation. Also, I'm about 5'10'' and 230lbs.

For reference, at my office, they have Aeron's currently, which I've used at other places. I'm fine with the Aeron, but it's never been one of my favorites as, being a heavier guy, I can feel the support rods under the mesh seat. I've also had various All Steel and Steelcase seats at work, not sure of the all of the precise models. I'm not super picky and usually as long as a chair is decent, I'm okay with it but I do definitely have my preferences.

Gesture Impressions (vs Leap V1)

1. Arms: I like the ability to move the arms around and position them at different heights. I have a L-shaped corner desk and used to end up resting my arm on part of the desk, but the way in which the desk connects (via a metal support bar) means it's not the greatest for weight bearing. With the Gesture's arms I'm able to pull it in and elevate and quite like this. I generally find the arms an improvement (keep in mind the Leap V1 has more basic arms than the V2 I believe) but wouldn't say that alone would decide. I dislike that the arms don't lock, however, as they shift around a bit at times depending on what I'm doing
2. Lumbar/back: This is what I was most worried about as I saw more complaints about this on the Gesture than anything. I've had no issue here and like it fine relative to my leap. I tend to allow the seat to recline freely and generally sit pretty upright, but occasionally recline backward. I've never perceived either undue pressure \*or\* the support being in somewhat insufficient.  I generally don't notice it much. It might be a tad less aggressive than the Leap but not really a notable difference. The fact that the seatback goes higher I do like and when I tried the Leap again I noticed this.
3. Seat cushion: Little conflicted here. I'd read from some that the seatpad felt thin or hard. I don't find that and it feels actually more cushioned than my Leap. Keep in mind, though, my Leap is a V1 and almost 20 years old so is probably quite compressed. The Gesture is fine, though. What I like less than the leap is the square shape, I tend to stick my leg out at a 45 degree angle at times. This feels fine on the Leap's rounded seat, but feels uncomfortable on the Gesture's square seat. The other thing with the Gesture is it feels slightly forward tilting, like you might slide off. This bothered me a bit at first, but I stopped noticing so it's not really an issue now.
4. Headrest: I've never had a chair with a headrest and wasn't sure if I should get it. It's a pretty expensive add on and wasn't sure I'd use it. I've also seen people complain about it pressing into their head when not being used. I actually am very glad I got it. It doesn't even touch my body when I'm stting in an upright position and occasionally I'll recline, especially when playing games and I really like being able to sort of relax/slouch and have the head support.

After using the Gesture consistently, I went back and used the Leap for a bit. I hadn't felt the Gesture was a huge upgrade after I switched, but in going back the Leap felt way way less comfortable than I remembered. I really like the Gesture and am largely happy with it. My only (fairly minor) complaints are: the square seat shape, the non locking arms, and the slight forward tilt of the seat (which I don't really notice anymore). On the whole, I'm very happy. 

Was it worth $1500? I'm not sure, but no regrets on the purchase and hope some of this is helpful to those considering as an option. I'm gonna drop the Leap V1 off at my local Value Village as it's still quite functional and hopefully someone can get more use out of it. One of the reasons I went with Steelcase is that it was doing so well even after so many years."

Need something new,"I see most people in this sub talking about Gesture, Leap V2, and Herman Miller. I have a monitor above my work monitor to game on during slow days or when the wife wants to watch TV. I'm 6ft and 200lbs. What should I get? And where from?"

,A good office chair is a good gaming chair
Full Backrest for tall person under $600?,"I have an Ikea Jarvfjallet that I like alot but after a bit more than 2 years of weekend gaming it seems like the bottom has worn out on me. Probably because there's a solid 6 inches between my knees and the front of the seat which means my weight is less spread out, compressing the foam. I'm 6'2"" 275lbs. 

I don't have the budget for even a used steelcase gesture with a headrest and most of the chairs in this middle price point don't have a full back rest. Even more importantly, I need adjustable lumbar due toy height.

I know gaming chairs are bad but the Secretlab Omega Evo does have a full backrest and adjustable lumbar which are my top 2 concerns so I actually seems like my best option after a few hours of research. 

And for context: I sit on a human scale freedom at work and since the head of my office decided she didn't like the headrest we don't have them and I slouch ALL THE TIME because I hate the lack of support for my shoulders and I try and get some from the backrest by slouching. So I know what a premium chair is like and I found the IKEA far more comfortable because of the backrest."
,"Premium chair doesn't mean anything in your context, the chair has to have the correct adjustment and fit the person.. if you sit on an HM sayl for instance you will have the same problem, does it mean that the HM sayl is a shitty chair? absolutely not!

If i were you i would consider maybe an used herman miller aeron size C, (and most importantly, try the chair in person)

Looking for options in Spain.,"Hi everyone!

I'm looking for a new chair in Spain since current one is old and starting to fall apart.

The problem is that I can't find any great option (considering what I've read and been told by friends etc. about ""gaming"" chairs) under the \~380‚Ç¨ mark (SecretLabs), and I could maybe get that money, but in that case I'd need it to be something that lasts for years and years, and even in that situation I'm not completelly sure since some say that brand is S tier and other say it's just overpriced... and I couldn't care less about design, aesthetics, or whatever that is called, but I do need to give some relief to my back.

I know it's not much money, but it is what I could afford the most, so any cent I could keep would be nice.

I'm big, not ""The Rock"" big, but not small by any chance."
,"From what I read, Barcelona and Madrid have a lot of second hand, office space-dumped quality chairs from the top brands. Start with that."
,Check for preowned Steelcase chairs on Wallapop or get yourself a brand new spanish made Actiu chair. I'd recommend a Steelcase Please 2 (200-300‚Ç¨) or an Actiu Trim (300-400). If you don't have AC or proper ventilation breathable mesh is a MUST in Spain otherwise fabric will end up stinking due to sweat and bacteria.
How much could a Leap V2 with the leather add-on go for?,"It‚Äôs not damaged, however, it‚Äôs been used for ~2 years now. No pets / smoke."
,"600 is what you would pay for fully refurbished chair with a 12-year warranty and shipping from some of our favorite refurbers.  

I would think without the delivery and the warranty and the refurb, I would look to be around half to 2/3 of that price so 300 or 400 would be the range I would think of as fair.  Anything under $300 would be a bargain."
,I think $300-$350 is fair if it's still within the 12 year warranty period.
Comfy office chair recommendations?,"I‚Äôm looking for an ergonomic chair that is also comfy. I want to be able to use the chair for work (sitting for 10-12 hours each day) but I also want to recline and relax. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1‚Äù, 185lbs. 

I was leaning towards the Steelcase Gesture with headrest, but saw in some reviews that it‚Äôs only good for a few hours at a time, as the seat is a bit stiff. I started looking at the Steelcase Leap Worklounge, but I‚Äôm not sure if this would be good for working at desk, or if this is just a lounger. Also not sure if the Worklounge would be good for my height, not to mention the price is outside of what I want to spend.

At work I have the Haworth fern - it‚Äôs ok, but I would like something a little more plush, and a better headrest. Previously I had the Aeron and didn‚Äôt like it - I felt I was being bounced out of my seat.

Slow build up of neck pain and headaches with the embody,"My new logitech embody arrived last week.

Its by far the most comfortable desk chair ive ever sat in, but it has 1 very big flaw - im still determining how much of a deal breaker this is, or if ill get used to it, but im rather concerned I wont.

The backfit. When loosened you get a non-supportive but very comfortable back for reclining, when tightened I get the lower back and lumbar support I need for upright sitting - BUT I have the top of the chair pushing me forward. 

If I where shorter, it would probably be fine, but im 6""2' and this is pushing my mid upper back forward in a very non-ergonomic hunch. Maybe not such a big issue, but over time it causes very strong neck pain and headaches. Ive litterally never sat in a chair before that was able to give me headaches, and it feels very unnatural to be forced to hunch over by my chair.

Really not sure what to do. If the upper back was just less-pushy-forwardy the chair would be perfect. Im going to keep using it for now and chug some painkillers when it gets bad. I had a nasty experience with the gesture so my next option would probably be the aeron - which I doubt is anything like this comfortable (and you cant cross your legs), but will at the very least be fully configurable to my body and ergonomic."
,"Sure sounds like a deal breaker üòû 

Your next chair should have a height-adjustable backrest, such as the [Sitmatic Goodfit](https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/6462143/Sitmatic-GoodFit-Standard-Ergonomic-Fabric-High/), [Bodybilt Aircelli](https://bodybilt.com/product/aircelli/), or [ergoCentric airCentric 2](https://www.healthyposturestore.com/seating/ergonomic-office-chairs/ergocentric-aircentric-2-desk-chair-for-tall-users-quick-ship/) or [tCentric Hybrid](https://www.healthyposturestore.com/seating/ergonomic-office-chairs/ergocentric-chair-tcentric-multi-tilt/)."

Is $750 for a supposedly brand new steelcase gesture with headrest a good deal?,First time getting a chair like this after my GTracing gaming chair finally broke and I went down the rabbit hole of gaming and office chairs and think a gesture w/ headrest is my best option (5'9 170lb).

Just know it's not technically brand new unless you get it from an authorized dealer.

Best cleaning methods for Leap V2,"Hi all,

Just picked up a couple of Leap V2s for $250 each.  I'm sure if I waited longer that I could have found a better deal, but I was pretty desperate to replace my terrible costco chair that causes a great deal of lower back and hip pain.  I initially bought a leap v2 from crandall but returned it because of excessive warp on the back pad, then purchased a gesture from them, but it did not include the lumbar so I am also sending that back.

The chairs are in great shape.  Everything works flawlessly.  Made in 2017 and the fabric has no stains or scuffs as far as I can tell, there is no warp on the back and cylinder is still working great.  With that said, I would still like to clean the chairs as much as I can.  I plan to wipe down the chairs with Clorox wipes.  I will be replacing one set of wheels with rollerblade wheels and havent decided whether I'll do the same for the other chair.

As far as cleaning the padding and fabric, I'm researching whether I should rent an upholstery cleaner or get a steam cleaner from amazon (or both?)  Which would be most effective at cleaning?

Very much looking forward to the new chairs!"
,Get both if you want to be thorough
,buy a new cylinder.  Also you're too fat so the new cylinder will break eventually too
,"Yeah I don't think you're going to find a base that's going to be a perfect fit for that cylinder, and if the component that holds that's cylinder in place is broken, that's probably a wrap on the chair."
,"Please help me.... Yes I admit I'm a heavy guy and weigh about 40 pounds more than the max, but is there any way I can easily remove this. I have tried banging it upside down and putting dish soap in the center but it just won't budge.

My last chair broke this way tooo. Collapsed and split the plastic. The plastic doesn't look cracked yet. Please help"
,"If the plastic base where the pneumatic cylinder goes into isn't broken, it should be an easy fix.
Be sure to look for any cracks.
If you don't have any cracks, I have a solution that might work.
Lay the chair on its back, preferably on carpet so it won't get scratched or damaged. Get a large hammer, like a 3 lb drilling hammer (it looks like a baby sledgehammer)
Hold the base with one hand near one of the wheels. You're going to hit the very bottom of the pneumatic cylinder, the part that would be closest to the floor. It should only take two or three times and the base will come off easily.
Next I would wrap some electrical tape around the pneumatic cylinder where it enters into the plastic base. I would start off with maybe one or two wraps and see how that works. If not add a little bit more.
I'm sure the others have advised that you may need a stronger chair. So if that doesn't work, it's time to buy another chair. Even if it does work, as it has for me many times, it may be prudent to start looking for other options.
Good luck!"

Is the Humanscale Freedom with Headrest something I can sleep in or does it only recline enough to still do work? Is it comparable to other chairs in it's price point ($1634)?"
,"No.

I do not think that's a good use case for this chair."
,"I think the Freedom is exactly the opposite of a chair where you lean back to slouch. Its dynamic headrest part of the backrest intends to keep your upper spine and neck looking at a monitor, which is why this may be one of the best chairs for working reclining since most other chairs have an upright, fixed headrest that is most intended for upright backrest use, while when leaning back on those, your nape and upper spine tilt back with it, forcing an obnoxious angle if you want to keep looking at a monitor in a comfortable desk height and perpendicular angle for upright chair use. So your eyes will not be looking directly to the front with those as opposed to the Freedom.

I also don't think the Freedom reclines more on the backrest part than the chairs you mentioned. For reference, I've had a Leap V2, and use a Zody daily while also having a Steelcase Please V2 and a Haworth Fern. I don't think any of them reclines enough as .last gaming chairs, but I've had 5 or 6 accidental naps on my (custo headrest) Zody where I could sleep somewhat comfortably on my back, but my legs, even with a tall cube footrest, will always end up very tired due to the blood flow being stuck around my waist and buttocks. You can only sleep well when you're 100% horizontal to the floor because that's how your body knows when to open up the lower limb blood vessels and also how you take away pressure from the seating position, and distribute it across your contact points of head, shoulder, hip, knees and feet (sleeping sideways, the most ergonomic position to sleep to your spine).

I don't think even those stupid gaming chairs which almost do a 180 angle and have mechanically actuated leg rests will allow for comfortable sleeping because they don't cradle your back enough that gravity distributes weight accordingly. You will still get blood stuck on the hip/buttocks.

So TL:DR is the Freedom is (likely) not a good chair for sleeping in, because you would be sleeping in a curved back position and like all chairs, blood flow to the legs is hampered."
,"I dont think the higher end ergonomic supportive office/task chairs mentioned in this sub were ever designed to have a user sleep in them. You may be looking at the wrong types of chairs if that is something important to you. Maybe look for some lounge chairs that have an office chair base? Im not joking....they do exist out there.  
Also as much as im biting my tongue typing this...the god awful gaming chairs often feature full 135-degree recline capabilities to where you feel like you're going to fall over backwards. Maybe thats what you're looking for? Not sure how else I can help sorry.  


I have a guest bed in my home office and whenever I need a break I find it much more pleasurable to just go lay down on the bed or head for the couch. No desire to actually sleep in a chair at a desk.

,"To me, the chair is only good for lounging. My gf has the fully loaded headrest version and I have used the non-headrest version at work. Could never find a comfortable tasking position even with the tilt tension all the way up (there is no tilt lock/stop). It's the kind of chair that either fits you or it doesn't. I just find it too loose overall, especially the back rest.

The headrest does not recline at the same angle as the back of the chair either, so when entering the recline, the headrest sits more forward and pushes on your head/neck. This is fine for gaming, movies, scrolling your phone etc but not ideal for sleeping.

That being said, I could definitely catch some Z's on her chair with my feet up.

Edit: just tested it, the recline angle is not much more than 90 degrees. Would not recommend."

,"I‚Äôve had a human scale freedom with headrest for 14 years.  You cannot and should not sleep in it.

As the other user said, the headrest is designed to angle the head so it can keep facing the screen.  That can put some serious pressure on the neck if sustained for long periods associated with sleeping.  Imagine sleeping on your back with your head resting on something uncomfortably high like a basketball.

Second, the freedom has no locking mechanism.  It‚Äôs designed to balance your weight against itself in recline.  As a result, when fully reclined, if you move around it will basically want to return to a seated position.  You‚Äôd have to hold VERY STILL in recline, and that would be very uncomfortable while sleeping.  You could not roll to one side, because it would snap upwards.  It would be like sleeping on a yoga ball, in the sense that it would have the same unstable balance dynamics.  Lots of people hate the freedom chair because of this, everyone expects it to lock.

In terms of the recline depth, yes it reclines further than my leap v2.  The Aeron I have doesn‚Äôt change it‚Äôs angle between backrest and seat pan; like cheap chairs it only leans the whole seat backwards.  So yes it‚Äôs nice to feel the hip flexors opening up when reclining on it.  It‚Äôs great to lounge on while thinking of problems or watching a movie.  It‚Äôs not good for sleep.

Have I slept in it?  Yes, but only when I was exhausted, and generally by accident.  I woke up with muscle pain and neck pain.  I know it looks like a desntist‚Äôs chair but it doesn‚Äôt work like one.  It is a great task chair though.

I‚Äôm not sure why you are trying to find a chair that you can sleep in, but I strongly strongly urge you to find a separate solution for sleep.  Get a little sofa next to where you work if you must rest nearby.  I do that.  Don‚Äôt sleep in any task chair, they aren‚Äôt meant for it and the long term result will be pain and injury at a minimum.  Even a pillow on the floor would be superior."

Steelcase Gesture With Headrest vs Other Options,"6'2 180 guy here and cannot decide between the Gesture with Headrest or without (or even a Leap/HM).  WFH 2x a week and game so need something comfortable for the long haul.  Also want a chair that helps me improve my (currently poor) posture.

I've combed through old reddit threads and have seen very different opinions on the headrest...seems like it is one of the better headrests out there but still looks like it could push my head/neck forward which may reinforce poor posture.  Wanted to see if anyone else had new thoughts?"
,"For people without serious neck strength issues, a headrest isn't necessary for keeping your head in neutral posture square above the shoulders upright tasking. In fact, relying on a headrest may lead you to *develop* such issues.

What really helps is an ergonomic workstation arrangement that discourages poor posture, including monitor(s) close enough to your eyes that you don't subconsciously lean forward with your neck or torso. Sitting in a slight recline helps maintain good head posture as well, no headrest required.

Headrests are great for deep reclining though."
,"In my experience headrests are completely subjective and come down entirely to ones personal preference. I wouldn't make a decision on that based on other peoples opinions. There are definitely mixed reviews on here.All I will say is we have had far more customers order a Gesture w/o headrest and ask if there's anyway they could order/add one after the fact, as opposed to far less customers who order a Gesture w/ headrest and ask if there anyway to remove it because it doesn't work for them or they don't like it.

Is there somewhere you can go try them both out in person to compare and see what feels right for you? I would recommend doing that if at all possible.  


Edited: afterthought - I should probably mention that it is NOT possible to add a Gesture headrest to a Gesture that was manufactured without one. However it is possible to remove (and re-attach) a headrest from a Gesture that was manufactured with one.  
So if you really cant decide I would suggest buying one with and you could always take it out by disassembling the back of the chair. Just thought id throw this out there too.

Sore tailbone lower/back,"So i had staples executive chair for 2 years and now i think seat is giving in. 

I bought a hyken to replace it but it was worse.
My thighs were sore, my tailbone was aching like crazy, and so was my lowerback.
I am 5‚Äô10 205 pounds with fairly big butt. 

I was wondering if
1) it was me or hyken. I did notice my tailbone had no support. I heard you need chair to break in. However i was wondering if the curved seat does not suit my body type. Anyone had similar expeciences?

2) assuming curved seat did not suit my body type i am wondering if i should consider steelcase leap? 

3) which chairs would you recommend? I am considering HM embody and gesture, however i heard gesture has a notch near tailbone.

4) any other chair recommendations?"
,"The Hyken just isn't sized for big butts. It's smaller and narrower than the average office chair. You'd be better off in most other chairs, so you don't necessarily need a high-end chair (though if you can afford one, at least  they'll last you a long time)."
,"for lower back the best fix is aggressive lumbar and to tilt your chair back if possible---or to use recline if that's all you can do.  

It'll spread your weight out to all bones instead of sitting 90 degrees upright, which sends all of your torso weight straight to the lower back"

Refurbished Steelcast LeapV2 squeak near lower back firmness knob?,"Hello, I actually made a post about this awhile back but I thought I'd post again with a video in case anyone is familiar with it. My Refurbished LeapV2 started squeaking at some point and it seems that when I push the lower back firmness knob closer to the part of the chair back that its connected to, the sound completely stops for like 30 seconds after I let go, before it starts coming back.

Here is a video ( the sound I'm referring to is the louder squeak-type sound ).

In this video you can clearly hear when i push those 2 plastic bars closer together the sound completely stops.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpe34SiGcXk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpe34SiGcXk)

$500 WFH/Gaming Chair - Steelcase Amia (Refurb) vs Secret Labs Titan Evo 2022 vs Eurotech Vera,"**TLDR:**

Eventually, I will shill out and buy a $1500 chair, but for now, my budget is around $500. I'm looking at 3 chairs: **Secret Labs Titan Evo 2022, Steelcase Amia (Refurbished),** and the **Eurotech Vera**. I am also listening to any recommendations. Let me know your thoughts.

**BACKGROUND:**

I'm 23, 5'6"" around 150lbs give or take 5 pounds depending on holidays lol. I finally got an adult Work From Home job, and I want to invest in a good chair since I'm sitting for 12+ hours most days. I work about 8-9 hours and like to game in my free time as well. I like to get up and move around during the day but sometimes I'm swamped and have to sit for the majority of my day with little breaks. 

I'm asking here because I try to take my health seriously, especially with how long I have to sit, so I'm going to slowly upgrade my home office to be customizable, ergonomic, and comfortable with a standing desk and everything, but I wanted to start with a good chair because I try to take good care of my back with regular exercise since I had a couple of back injuries in high school that sometimes like to rear their ugly head. 

**HOW I SIT:**

I like to change how I'm sitting frequently throughout the day, whether it's crisscross, one leg crossed, normal posture, slouched, etc. I just hate staying still for too long. 

I'm not sure what kind of chair I would like the best, I've never had an opportunity to try any mid/high-tier chairs, but I'm not a huge fan of gaming chairs.

**CHAIRS:**

I have a budget of around **$500**. I know gaming chairs aren't a good choice, but when reviewers give better options, they always list the obvious **Aeron, Leap v2, etc.** but never any similarly priced chairs. From my research, I've found 3 chairs I'm considering, but want to hear people's opinions on any others they would recommend, and why.

&#x200B;

* **Secret Labs Titan Evo 2022 (Small)**
* **Steelcase Amia (refurbished)**
* **Eurotech Vera**

&#x200B;

I have had many coworkers and friends tell me to get the Secret Labs Titan Evo 2022 based on their own experience, and although I want to stay away from gaming chairs, this is the only one that has stayed as an option, especially with the changes in the 2022 version. I like the idea of something I can sit with good posture in with the new lumbar support, but can still lounge when I'm relaxing. I know it won't be the best option out there, but I have reliable sources that it's at least comfortable.

The Steelcase Amia seems to be what I'm leaning toward, I think I'd prefer the thicker seat compared to the Leap v2 and the less aggressive lumbar support. Refurbished, I can find them for a little under $500 but it's always a toss-up when buying something used. It seems like a chair I can still lounge in, but will be much more comfortable in a good ergonomic position, it has me thinking maybe I'll sit like that more if I had a more comfortable chair.

The Eurotech Vera seems like a good comfortable option if I decide to go with a mesh chair. It would be nice to have a new chair, but would it be a worse option than going with a refurbished, technically better chair? I like again how the chair would be comfortable to lounge in, but I'm worried that it doesn't have an option for lumbar support, but I might prefer that I'm not sure yet. At least with the Amia, if I don't like the lumbar support it can be removed."
,"Both the Vera and the Amia are solid choices. I suggest the Amia from a reputable refurbisher. It's a great well rounded chair. If you are considering the Vera, don't worry it has great lumbar support despite not having adjustable lumbar support."
,"Depending on what you mean by ‚Äúlounging,‚Äù keep in mind that there is no headrest option for the Amia, either OEM or 3rd party. Conversely the Vera has an official headrest that can be purchased with the chair or aftermarket from BTOD for example."
,"Biggest advantage of the Leap over the Amia is that it can recline further back. If you are used to the Leap, the Amia's recline will feel limited if you want to stretch out. If the Amia reclined further, then it might be more popular."
,"""At least with the Amia, if I don't like the lumbar support it can be removed.""

This applies more to the Leap, as you can easily remove the extra lumbar attachment. You technically can remove the Amia's lumbar, but it's more built in to the design, so not recommended.

You can also dial down the Leap's built in lumbar to be much less aggressive, like the Amia's less aggressive lumbar.

Personally, I like both chairs, but for lounging, the Leap beats the Amia. For drafting or office work, then it could go either way, But if you want to stretch out more, then the Leap is objectively better."
,"Personally I would go with the Vera. I remember looking at it before and it seemed solid.

Refurb chairs can be hit or miss in my experience. Cushions can be worn out etc. Gaming chairs also usually aren't that good."

Recommendation for a WFH chair in Canada?,"I am 5'10, and I weigh around 65 Kg.

"My user story: Leap (2014 - 2021), Aeron (2021 - present)","Switch from Leap to Aeron in 2021.

I think for me, the Aeron is the ""less comfortable"" of the two.

On Aeron, I never feel ""nestled"" in, instead, it feels like the chair is constantly trying to push me off in some way.

However, that is the whole point of a ""good chair"". Humans are not ergonomically supposed to sit down 8+ hrs a day. A chair that makes doing so ""comfortable"" is akin to taking pain killers to numb pain.

The fact that sitting on Aeron is tolerable or bearable but never comfortable is exactly the attribute a good chair should have.

100% just my opinion."
,"the pain is good argument is a myth.  It's an excuse used by crappy chair manufacturers.  Pain is okay for the first time use if you have bad posture but it will go away in about 2 days.  If your chair isn't able to handle the gold standard 8-12 hour test then you could have just used a cheapo $100 chair and saved the money

From the description, I see you can get the chair without arm rests, a shorter stem, etc. But when I go to customize, it doesn't have any of these options.

Anyone know where I can order with actual customization options?"

Best Office Chair Recommendation for WFH Lumbar and Back Support,"Hello everyone!

I am 25, wfh full-time, and am doing a computer science masters at nights. To say the least, I sit a lot (some semester 16 hours a day)! I am a 5'11, 170 pounds male. The last few years, sitting all the time has taken a toll on my back, with lower back pain being something I have to deal with. Increasing my activeness with sports and the gym along with core strengthening and stretching has helped tremendously! With that said, I am rocking a $50 chair off of Amazon... the next logical step seems to be to invest heavily in a top of the line office chair with lumbar support ideally. I would like to spend less than $1k, but budget is not strict. I also live in an area with a ton of these things posted for sale secondhand, so the used route is definitely on the table. My partner also sits a lot too, and she deals with similar discomfort in her neck region. I point this out, because I am open to buying a couple so that her and I can try them out and see what we like. What would you all recommend?"

"I like sitting in the lotus position for hours, any suggestions for comfortable chairs?","Hey everyone!   


I'm looking into buying a chair that preferably supports lotus-style sitting. I don't have back problems (I do posture and back exercises regularly; I generally don't slouch or lean in), but I typically sit in the lotus position (completely cross-legged) most of the time.

I work from home (7-8h at my desk, with breaks) and in the evening I game for another 1-2h (or more, on occasion).

If it's relevant at all, I type from a keyboard tray that's at about the same level as my knees, and I sit at a relatively low desk (the keyboard is 65cm from the ground, the desk is 75cm from the ground). Because of the way everything is arranged, I basically type with my elbows resting on my thighs. I'm about 165cm tall.

I've looked into expensive ""gaming"" chairs. The armrests get in the way of my legs, and the lumbar support cushion feels more annoying than supportive. I do like the high back, though, and the head rest is okay (though it doesn't feel necessary).

I've also looked into office chairs. Many in the store also have armrests, short backs as well as bowl-shaped seats, so that my thighs rest uncomfortably on the rim of the seat. 

Standing desks aren't really an option for me because my feet and legs get restless from more than 30min of standing in one position. At some point I develop a strong urge to cross my legs (could be restless legs syndrome, not sure, although I do have a slight iron deficiency).

&#x200B;

Does anybody know of a type or brand of chair that would be comfortable for somebody with a (probably weird) sitting position like mine? Preferably under 300 Euros but price is not a dealbreaker. Any and all advice is appreciated and welcome!"
,"Checkout the Pipersong chair.

Disclaimer: I never have used one before, but it‚Äôs specifically for cross legged sitters."
,"I just got a (fabric version) andaseat kaiser 3 a few days ago,really comfy seat. I can sit lotus in it and arm rest move plenty for me but also think they might be movable if unscrewed and moved out (would need to double check that). Has built in lumbar,not sure what I make of that yet though and need to give that more time. Worth having a look at."
Review of my Mavix M5,"This is my first non-ikea office chair, so I don't exactly have a large sample size but here we go!  


PROS:  


* Mid-market price point  
Many ergonomic office chairs start at $1000 or more. The M5's sticker price is $555
* Very adjustable  
adjustable lumbar, headrest, and armrest. The adjustable lumbar is the winning feature here for sure. My upper back pain is gone.
* Easy assembly  
only took me about 15 minutes. nice.
* 12 year warranty  


CONS  


* wobbly armrests. if you use your armrests a lot consider upgrading to the nicer ones they sell
* upgrades are quite pricey  


OVERALL THOUGHTS:

If you're like me and have a hard time justifying 1k on a chair you should consider the M5. I wouldn't reccomend the base model (M4) or the next model up (M7). The adjustable back and headrest are really the most important features, the M4 isn't adjustable and IMHO the M7 is mostly bells and whistles. I worked from home in a shitty office chair before getting the M5 and it was a serious life improvement."
Help finding deals.,"Any places where I can find any deals to buy a a steelcase or Herman Miller online? I live in the Caribbean and there is absolutely no market for any of these chairs here so it's impossible to buy one.

If I buy a chair over 200$ online and get it shipped here I will also get taxed 18%  of the price of the chair so it just makes it way more expensive.

I really need a good chair since I spend all day on the computer and I keep getting back pain but all the chairs being sold here are cheap Chinese chairs :(

My budget is $350 or so!"
,"In a very small market, particularly on an island, I wouldn't be surprised there is not much of a second hand furniture scene.

Steelcase Think (w/ headrest) VS. Noblechairs Hero TX,"Hey guys,

Tried to find some comparisons regarding these two chairs but I couldn't really find anything...

Can someone help me decide between these two ? The Think model has plenty adjustments but it's almost 2x the price of the Hero TX. The thing that really attracts me about the Noblechairs model is the design and the ''fluffy'' seats/backrests.

For a guy that spends 8/9 hours working from home, which one do you think that suits me better?

Thanks a lot

,"So as someone who also is in their home office 8-10ish hours a day and was making a similar choice recently, I have to tell you I do not regret buying a proper ergonomic chair.  Yeah, it's not as ""comfortable"" as a gaming chair at first sit, but damn does it make me feel so much better at the end of the day than plusher chairs ever did.  

The initial difference being that with a gaming chair I would sit in it and go man, that's comfortable, but then at the end of the day I'd feel pretty beat up.  With my ergonomic chair I sit in it and go meh, but after 8 hours in it I get up and I'm like damn, I feel great.  It's never uncomfortable either, it just doesn't give that initial comfort wow a plusher chair does.  It basically forces me into having good posture which seems to translate into feeling way better at the end of a long day.  If I were making the choice again I would 100% go ergonomic and that's not even considering the awesome warranty from Steelcase."

,These chairs are real 100% There are no fake Embody‚Äôs or Gestures that I have ever seen and I‚Äôve been in a chair enthusiast for a long time and I have never seen a knock off. These chairs are cheap but you aren‚Äôt getting a warranty with them so you get what you pay for but if it comes with a new box then I wouldn‚Äôt worry about the age of the chair but I would make sure that the chairs are clean and up to par because you‚Äôll need these chairs to last you a lifetime without a warranty. I have the LE for almost 2yrs now and it is the best chair money could buy but it‚Äôll be a pita to get it warranties out because my previous employer bought it for me as part of an award for being the top salesman 6 months in a row. I never returned the chair but I think the one loophole is that they will allow me to claim warranty since I got it as a gift.

Steelcase Gesture strike out #2,"So I bought a returned Steelcase Gesture (w/ headrest) twice now from Crandall and both times have been a strikeout. I‚Äôm technically on my third because I didn‚Äôt like the color of the first one, but anyway..

2nd Gesture had two issues:
- Headrest was loose to the point that when my head moved off of it, it came back to hit me in the head. It also creaked. 
- Fabric had pinches in it. 

3rd Gesture has two issues:
- Headrest is solid but still creaks. All 3 Gestures had a creaking headrest..
- Worst of all, this Gesture has now developed a HORRIBLE creak. Yes I tried the white lithium grease method that Crandall even has a video on. The creak happens with side to side backrest movement and also seems to be happening in the seat base. 
VIDEO: https://youtu.be/j2WyxowsMGc

So to the point of this post, I‚Äôm kind of losing faith in the Gesture. I‚Äôm really happy with how I fit in it (wouldn‚Äôt mind a tick more room), the seat and back comfort is good, headrest is nice especially moving it out of the way when not needed, and I love the arm adjustability. I‚Äôm just getting fed up with these issues and am getting ready to give up on this chair. The only problem is, I have no idea what I‚Äôd ever replace it with. That new Herman Miller chair looks like a joke unfortunately, and, at this point, I‚Äôm contemplating getting another Secretlab Titan. If my Gesture is this bad now, I can‚Äôt see it ever lasting a long time. 

PS: none of this is Crandall‚Äôs fault. Their customer service is second to none. They‚Äôre even investigating a fix for me as we speak. Just wanted some input from others in the meantime."
,No matter what you do every chair is going to creak. I have the Logitech Embody which was known for creaking and in the beginning when I first bought the chair it freaked but not anymore after almost 2yrs in the chair. Now it doesn‚Äôt make any sounds and works perfectly. You need to give the Gesture some more time sitting in it. The creaking will go away. I promise you.
,"Have you tried sitting in a new Gesture in an authorized dealers showroom to see it feels any different? Obviously the chair was returned for a reason so I'm not too surprised you struck out and found imperfections in chairs that someone else had already returned previously before you. Steelcase is starting to not honor warranty claims on Amazon Warehouse returns because they has been an unusually high amount of issues with them. These chairs were built to barely be freighted from Point A to point B, 

*let alone Point A -> Point B -> Back to Point A -> then to point C -> Then finally you at point D.*

  
 Crandall is great in their market, they're a wonderful option if you're on a tight budget but its not a magical cheat code to getting the same product everyone else is paying retail for. There will always be some compromises. One should not expect 100% quality for a fraction of the price on a return/refurb model.

,"I bought a brand new gesture not too long ago after messing with used / refurbed ones, and I'm happy to report the new ones have zero noise."
,">If my Gesture is this bad now, I can‚Äôt see it ever lasting a long time. 

Gestures are one of the creakier chairs I've come across.

That being said, they do hold up fine. The creaks don't translate into impending catastrophic failure, unlike on cheaper chairs. The creaks merely are annoyances. 

The headrest issue is pretty common too. 

I think Steelcase tried too hard on the Gesture to do certain things and failed hard.

I think part of the creaking has to do with the design of the seat. The Gesture has probably the smallest mechanisms of any Steelcase chair. More of the seat on the Gesture is unsupported than any other Steelcase chair. One thing I've noticed and others have noticed is that moving side to side in the Gesture can cause creaking. 

Also, the recline creak. God that is annoying."
,">The only problem is, I have no idea what I‚Äôd ever replace it with.

That we can help with. What's your height? And do you use the headrest for upright tasking or just reclining?"
,"Was this terrible creaking a problem right away after you got the chair, or did it start later?  I just got a refurbished Gesture from Crandall yesterday, and it's completely silent.  Not sure if I just got lucky or if I should be worried about this being a problem later."

I'm having some difficulty trying to modify a 462 leap stool chair.,"So last weekend I manage to get my hands on a leap, but the chair is a bit too high for me to sit in. This was my purchasing an office chair for myself and I didn't realize there tons of different models of leap v2, and the one I happened to snag was a 462 leap stool chair (model no. 46267189). 

I think the main culprit is that the stool parts of the chair is getting in the way of being able to adjust the chair downwards more, but I'm having trouble finding something that can guide me through the process. The best I could muster was this document:  
[https://s3.amazonaws.com/steelcase.productdata.psl/PROD/AssemblyDirections/AD1622/Rev\_A/Version\_1/c815a46d-6dc4-4d60-a08e-3c839d60e7fd/9504705.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/steelcase.productdata.psl/PROD/AssemblyDirections/AD1622/Rev_A/Version_1/c815a46d-6dc4-4d60-a08e-3c839d60e7fd/9504705.pdf)

In terms of the bottom of the chair, it seems to match what I have. In particular, I haven't seen any other documents that includes the pin support and a base that doesn't have the cylinder go completely through it. But, the document is a bit confusing for me to follow and I was wondering if anyone knew of a better resource."

,"I‚Äôll copy/paste my reply to the same question recently:

I have a Leap V2 and Aeron Classic.  The Leap is my daily driver, and I use the Aeron if I need a change of pace.  In my mind, a deciding factor between these two chairs is your sitting habits.  Do you ever sit cross legged or tuck a leg underneath?  If so, the Aeron is eliminated.  You can‚Äôt sit comfortably in it in those positions.  The Aeron demands that you sit with correct posture.  If you typically sit with both feet flat on the ground, then you should consider the Aeron.  It is a great premium chair if you intend to always sit correctly."

I'm looking to purchase a chair for my neck. Basically got diagnosed with compressed nerves. I'm a programmer/data person so I'm on my computer a lot.

I have a standing desk but ideally looking for a better chair that can maybe lessen the amount of tension I put on my neck.

,"Pardon if this doesnt apply to you given your condition, but it is important to keep your head in neutral posture square above your shoulders. Don't lean in to read small text on the screen; if you find this necessary, instead bring your monitor(s) closer to your eyes or increase your general font size. Sitting in a slight recline helps prevent forward head posture as well.

As for shoulders scrunching, a split keyboard helps by letting you keep your hands further apart from each other. It is also important for your desk to be aligned with your *resting* elbow height so your shoulders can stay relaxed while typing/mousing."
,"Do you require a headrest for upright tasking due to your neck issues? If so, know that headrest fit is difficult to predict without testing chairs in person.

"Steelcase Leap v2 is tough on my lower back, anyone else have this issue?","Did a lot of research, and ended up getting the Leap V2.

But it's really tough on my lower back. My lower back started getting tired after only 10-15 mins.

I removed the lumbar support, but it still has the issue. I noticed the chair's natural curvature is pretty extreme, and juts out.

Anyone else have a similar issue? Or is it just me. This is my first high-end chair. Everything else about it the cushions, armrest, etc are all fantastic, but my lower back simply isn't comfortable, and I'm a bit bummed out."
,"I'm not a doctor so if you have serious pain please disregard and contact a professional. 

However when I used my Leap for the first time I had some abnormal tightness as well. I think it was more like my back was so used to my crappy racing chair that it was readjusting to a proper supportive chair.  Relaxing muscles that used to be flexed which caused other muscles to tense that I wasn't used to. 

Now it's extremely comfortable. 

Like I said if you have serious pain please contact a pro.  However the Leap V2 is basically perfect for the 5%-95% of the population by design."
,"If you used to slouch a lot, it can take some time to adjust. Give it 3-4 weeks (or just under your return period) to improve. If it doesn't, perhaps the Leap's lumbar support is too pronounced for you."

2 weeks later and it feels like a cloud. Can sit 12 hours a day and not be in pain."
,"I received my Leap a few days ago. My back has been hurting too, but I‚Äôm taking the advise of others and sticking it out. But I keep second-guessing the height and tension setting on the lumbar - I think it‚Äôs ok now, but it‚Äôs hard to say. 

This is my first purchase of a high end chair. It‚Äôs very exciting! I‚Äôve been suffering from sciatica problems and I‚Äôm trying to improve my posture as much as possible. You know you‚Äôre getting old when you‚Äôre excited about office chairs."

5‚Äô10 250lbs $300-400 budget,"Ive been searching this sub with my body dimensions but i cannot find anything with my specifications. Theres no used market to me locally. Anything purchased mostly likely online im in the US Pacific Northwest. I play games a lot on the computer and sit for 6-8hrs a day. Main concern is back support and my big thighs fitting comfortably in the seat. I have a staples hyken which i liked for the most part but my thighs and legs hurt as that chair seems to be too small, Appreciate any recommendations."
,"You'll find countless posts in this sub in regards to the Steelcase Leap chair. Very very popular model from a reputable higher end brand.

I would consider looking into the Steelcase Leap Plus. Same as the Leap but with a wider seat pan and higher weight capacity (500 lbs). Although buying one brand new is certainly out of your budget and I would imagine finding one used in considerable condition would be pretty difficult, I thought I'd throw it out there considering you sit for  6-8 hours a day and would benefit from the ergonomic design.

,"I highly recommend this [Bowery Hill chair](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bowery-Hill-22-5-Modern-Metal-and-Fabric-Mesh-High-Back-Task-Chair-in-Black/439217586) for its high build quality, comfort, and adjustability. It's covered by the 9to5 Seating @NCE 5-year warranty.

I believe the above chair should give you just enough room for your thighs between the armrests without contacting them. If you prefer to have ample room between the armrests, then go for HON Ignition 2.0 (comfy and adjustable but rather creaky)."
Used Knoll Generation & adding arms,"Can you add arms to a knoll generation that did not come from the factory with arms? Looking at a great deal on a used generation without arms, but I definitely want arms rests. Could I buy arms from knoll to add or will the frame of the chair lack the necessary connective parts?

(Apologies if this has been answered elsewhere. 10 mns of searching yielded no luck!)"
,You can't even find armpads at a reasonable price for them anywhere. eBay would probably be the only place to look.
,In Canada a replacement arm pad alone runs you about $50-70. With the whole arm its around $150. This is just a single arm.  Best bet is not add arms or look for one with arms.

,"BTOD‚Äôs review of the Branch Ergonomic was essentially ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bother.‚Äù

If going Aeron, be sure you want the chair telling you how to sit. The main complaint I see is ‚Äúif I try to sit in anything other than the neutral ergonomic position, the frame digs into me.‚Äù"
,which one should i get?
,Just a heads up that the Branch Verve has been a total misery. Wrecked my back even though I have no history of back issues. I think the hard protruding lumbar support is part of the issue. Not sure if that's the same on the Ergo Chair.
Durable office chair that you can recline on?,"Hey

I got a chair but I really want one that can support my head/neck if I lean back, and also one that you can recline on, kick back and listen to music in (for example). So a chair where the back goes all the way up or has a headrest.  


I know it's not an office chair but the secret lab ones look good for the recline. Any other reccs?  


Cheers"
,Herman Miller embody or aeron have the best recline mechanisms out there if you want to spend money. Embody for natural built in neck support for sure. You can also add a head rest to the Aeron from atlas. You can typically find both these chairs used for half the retail price.

"Best adjustable office chair under $800 for a petite (5'2"" 105lb) person?","Hello, I have a job where I sit all day long, and have long struggled to find an ergonomic setup. Currently I use a footrest to keep my leg/knee perpendicular to the floor and chair seat, and find myself always sitting on the edge of the seat as otherwise my arms wouldn't be able to reach the keyboard to type in a comfortable way, and subsequently, I also have to stuff at least 2 pillows behind my back as sitting this way doesn't allow my back to touch the seatback. The armrests are always too wide because the seat itself is too wide.  I looked on Amazon and haven't seen any task chairs that have a lower seat depth and width which would enable my back to actually touch the seatback.  I'm scared to order a really expensive chair only to find limited adjustment capability to my petite frame so any tips/advice especially if you have real-life experience as a petite individual or know someone who is petite would be greatly appreciated!"
,">Currently I use a footrest to keep my leg/knee perpendicular to the floor and chair seat

"Seat Recommendations, Specifics Below","Hello all, I was urged here while seeing the Halo x Haworth Fern chair. As mentioned there, I'm kinda new to office chairs in general, having jumped from chair to chair throughout my ""office career"" and am hoping for some recommendations on a decent chair in my budget.

Budget: >$700 (Not against used, I have seen a few Embody chairs below the mark, also not apposed to going over, but I am married, and I believe that is enough of a reason)  
Height: 6ft 2in (187.96cm)  
Weight: 235lbs  
Use case: I am an IT Engineer so I sit most of the day for my current position, and when not working at my desk or in the office, I play video games (*a little too much tbf*)

Special Requests: I have a lot of back pain, I served in the US Marines for 8 years, so plenty of running (bad knees), rucks (bad back) and martial arts/sparring (bad every joint). Every chair I sit in causes some pain in my lower back after long hours causing me to stop work and stand/stretch, however my office is equipped with Steelcase Series 1s which surprisingly allow me to sit for multiple hours without much pain.

Caveats: My at home desk has both my personal PC and work PC on it, and my work monitors are physically on top of my normal monitors, so I look up throughout the day. Also I like to recline my chair and relax in it if I can.

Any recommendations are welcome, although I prefer a chair that has a headrest or *can have a headrest* to allow me to lean back when needed."
,"I mean‚Ä¶you know for a fact that the Series 1 does you right, so‚Ä¶

Also, get those damn monitors down and buy some HDMI switches."
,I recommend this [9to5 Seating Theory 2180](https://officechairsoutlet.com/collections/9-to-5/products/9-to-5-theory-high-back-ergonomic-task-chair-with-headrest-2180?variant=43109024825587) for you.
,"If you want to lean back, you might look into a Series 2 with headrest. The only downside I‚Äôve seen is that the seat cushion might be too firm."
,"> my work monitors are physically on top of my normal monitors, so I look up throughout the day.

Noooo!! This is so bad for you, at least your poor neck! Ensuring your monitors are at eye level at all times should be priority number one. Another comment recommended HDMI switches so you can use the same monitors for work and gaming - that's a great idea."
2ndhnd.com warning!,"For anyone thinking of buying a chair in the UK from 2ndhnd.com beware! 
Ordered a Steelcase Amia from them at the beginning of this month, had confirmation and an estimate of 5-10 days for dispatch. Time passed and I hadn't received any further notifications from them so decided to chase, sent them an email and got no response. I have been sending them emails and social media messages for the last 2 weeks and getting absolutely nothing back. 
Went on to trustpilot today and noticed lots of new 1-star reviews complaining of the same thing, with some stating they had received emails from lawyers saying 2ndhnd has gone into administration and won't be fulfilling orders!
Their website says nothing about this and seemingly is still taking orders as normal! 
I'm now chasing a refund through PayPal and hopefully will get some response from them, but it's been an absolutely horrible experience...

EDIT: Feel like this might read too much like I'm angry with them, of course I was feeling that way when my messages were getting no responses and I have been waiting a while for any updates! After reading about everything it all makes sense now and I do feel sorry for them. Just hoping all the customers can be dealt with and either they honour the orders or process refunds."
,"I can confirm they are out of business, insider.co.uk has an article on them. Maybe we can buy some of their stock? If anyone has a clue on how to do that, please let me know, I'm having some pain in my back. Thanks"
,"Such a shame, I just read an article from the other comment on this post. I just learnt that they're going into administration. I bought a chair from them about 2/3 months ago and it's the best chair I've ever owned, comfortable and and a good price. Hopefully everyone gets a refund from the company or from whichever payment provider they paid with in the last month. It looks like no one is going to get their chair."
,"This is really sad, I got an Aeron from them and it looks and feels brand new (still does)"
,"I was waiting for their restock of Leap v2s, shame to hear about this."
,"Bought a chair from them 2 weeks ago, chased for an update this morning and just got a letter via their lawyers saying they are in administration. Welp."
,You can still buy chairs on their website as if nothing had happened. Extremely deceptive practice.
,"The company has gone into administration. I see from uk.trustpilot that some people have received an email from the administrator, Henderson Loggie LLP.

Looking for a mesh reclining office chair with headrest under $1k USD.,"I currently use an Autonomous ErgoChair 2 (now Pro?). My wife's current chair is absolutely terrible and she either wants my chair or a new chair.

I work from home and my employer gives me $1k USD to spend on 'wellness' each year so I figured I'd spend it on a chair if I could.

I have no qualms with the quality or comfort of my current chair but buying another one seems out of the question since it seemingly has almost doubled in price and I feel like at the price point I should be able to get something better.

I haven't found a chair that hits the sweet spot with mesh, recline, and headrest. I like to kick back in my chair and put my feet on the desk when I'm watching something and want my head to be supported. I also have double-stacked monitors so I like having the headrest make sure I don't tilt my head too far back and end up straining my neck.

Would appreciate any and all recommendations.

Thanks!"

,Aeron Remastered with Atlas headrest would be the most obvious answer. I'm using this combo now and I'm pretty happy with it. Only con is you can't really cross your legs. A pro though is that it solved my shoulder pain and posture.

Steelcase Leap V2 (from 2019),"Hey people! I recently acquired a used Leap V2 for 400 CAD. It seemed like an amazing deal. The cylinder has been replaced and the arms as well. The cushion have not however. I've removed the lumbar support and my back is currently more comfy than my previous chair. 

My butt is asking for more cushions though :O ! I was wondering where I could buy replacement pads for the seat and back in Canada?"
,If it‚Äôs 2019 the pad really shouldn‚Äôt be worn out. If it is steam cleaning might help. Leaps just don‚Äôt have a lot of padding - too much cushion is apparently not ergonomic. If it‚Äôs really uncomfortable after a few days maybe try a cushion or gel pad.

Humanscale Diffrient World Mesh - how big you have to be to be too big for this chair?,"Hi guys,

as a lot of people I am looking for a nice chair around ¬£500, and I was ready to order Humanscale Diffrient World mesh, until I've read here:  


[Humanscale freedom headrest reddit - Google Search (btod.com)](https://www.btod.com/blog/popular-humanscale-office-chairs/)

&#x200B;

that it is a chair mostly for normal/petite people, and is the smallest one out there. I am 5'10-5'11 (around 180cm) and weight currently 190 pounds (86 kg, although I am cutting some calories).   


Would I be considered too big for this chair and should I look for something else? I have a chronic back pain (that is treated), but I also wanted to replace my not-so-perfect chair. 

&#x200B;

And just my second question - what's the difference between Humanscale Diffrient World Task and Humanscale Diffrient World Office?"
,"Hello there,

We work closely with Humanscale, they are a great reputable company and industry leader in environmentally friendly and sustainable products. Very cool if you're into that kind of stuff.

To answer your first question, I wouldn't say the chairs are mostly for normal/petite people. I am 6'2 220 and fit into all of their seating options just fine. They may not be the perfect fit for me personally but never once did it cross my mind that they were ""too small"". 

Based on your height/weight it sounds to me like even if it was tailored toward normal sized people, you would fit right into that category. I definitely wouldn't say you're too big if it has a weight capacity of 300 lbs...but I would highly recommend finding a place where you can try before you buy and make sure its good for you.  


Second question, The Diffrient World Task and Diffrient World Office are the same.....often referred to as the ""Diffrient World Office Task Chair"".   
Im going to assume you meant the difference between the ""World One Task Chair"" and the standard ""Diffrient World""? Given that the World One starts at $599 and all their other models are well over $1000+.

The spec's are identical in terms of Length, Height, Width, Seat height, recline range, and even chair weight. Only difference is the weight capacity with the standard World at 400lbs and the World One at 300lbs. It's looking like the only differences beyond that come down to slightly cheaper build quality and not as good of a warranty on the parts. As to be expected by a chair in this price range. Hope this helps!

,"How much can you spend? Good new ergonomic office chairs run $1000+. If that‚Äôs too rich buying used or refurbished can be a good option as these chairs are built to last 20+ years.

All in good condition. Anyone can help me with the suggestions? Thank you.

The chair: it's a decent chair but I've never had s chair that was sturdy and tall 

Specifications:
- I am a 6'3"" 230lb not obese just a big tall man. Skinny af at 225. I do have wide shoulders which I believe throws the balance off the chairs and wears out the twists and turns of the chair. 

I think I want a drafting chair that can lower. I'm a musician so I want the arms to raise away from so I can play.

Needs to be super sturdy and adjustable  for ALL heights."
,"Go with an Aeron or the Embody. 

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1 and 160lbs so I‚Äôm skinny asf and I sit in my Logitech Embody for 12+hrs per day 7 days a week working from home. When I‚Äôm not working I sit in the chair and rock back and forth in it because it‚Äôs super comfy. I can go hours without needing to get up and relax my back. I often forget how long I sit in the chair for because I‚Äôm so comfortable. No pain at all ever and I‚Äôve had the chair almost 2yrs now. The Logitech Embody is $1795 before discounts. 

The Aeron is a great choice but you‚Äôll need a size C and it punishes you if you don‚Äôt dit with good posture whereas the Embody doesn‚Äôt. This chair is roughly $1700 fully loaded in graphite. 

I also have the Gaming Sayl that my wife uses but it‚Äôs not fit for someone your height. It barely fits me but it‚Äôs super comfy as well. This is $900. 

Also, look into the Haworth Fern. They are generally around $1000 to start and they are a direct competitor of the Embody and they look nice too. 

Good luck!"

,Definitely a V2 and that's a great price. Check all the functions and make sure the fabric meets your specs
,"It looks like it. But unless it's in mint condition, or a big and tall variant it's not a very good deal. (Assuming US pricing and you're in a major city.)"
,Yes.
,"there are no counterfeit chairs, only ones that look like an extremely loose similar design

The Contessa for example looks similar to the steelcase

there's also a chair called the allsteel that is somewhat similar.

Counterfeit chairs would cost way too much to produce."
,"Ergo chairs are pretty good, the popular ones at the top of the list would be the Herman miller aeron and embody, steelcase leap v2 and gesture, haworth fern. But at the end of the day chairs are a bit like shoes, fits different for different people and you can only tell after sitting in them for a while."
,"There is not necessarily an office chair that will be perfect for everyone - your best chair may be completely different from mine and it really just depends on preference and height / weight. For example, the best chair for me being 5‚Äù 10 and 180 lbs is the Steelcase gesture, but you may prefer something else. Some of my favorites are : the Steelcase leap v2, Herman Miller embody, Herman Miller Mirra, Haworth very, and the Steelcase gesture of course. 

As far as pricing goes I highly recommend purchasing used, as Steelcase, Haworth and Herman miller chairs can run well over a thousand dollars new. Chairs from these brands are built very well and will last a very long time - so buying used is a great way to save money and still get a chair that will last you."
,"In my experience, if you ask 10 consumers, 9/10 will say something Herman Miller...if you ask 10 furniture experts you may get 2/10 that think Herman Miller is the best.  I prefer the Haworth Fern over everything but in general, I think Steelcase is the best overall brand.  Get them used locally for a fraction of retail price and dang that dining chair is gonna cost you a lot more in chiropracters, massage therapy and could be worse if you keep it up.  Back, butt, and neck doctors aren't cheap!"

Using two different office chairs?,"Any thoughts on using two different office chairs interchangeably? I have two desks, a Steelcase Gesture and an Aeron RM both with headrests. Any thoughts on whether this will impact my ergonomics, or will it be okay as long as I've dialed in comfort on both chairs?"
,"If they're both ergonomic chairs adjusted properly, using two chairs should be at least as ergonomic as using one."
,"Ideal solution tbh, I think switching chairs throughout the day, mixing in standing as well, is peak ergonomics. Static positions are the enemy, moving often solves most issues."
,"The only real issue with Steelcase is that once you start using one, you'll find that other chairs just aren't as good."
,"I got a steal on one for a similar price. My only thoughts on the chair secondhand:

The arm rests on mine were particularly rattly; I remedied this by putting a layer of masking tape around them. The base of the chair was also rather squeaky, so I used a long screwdriver to remove the seat base and lubricate the rails with some silicone lubricant. 

If you don't have either of those issues, you're probably good to go. Can give it a good steam cleaning or wipe down with a microfiber cloth with some dish detergent if you want to give it a good clean."

Does such a chair exist?,I now work from home AND and I am a bit of an audiophile. My listening room has become my home office. The room now consists of a large L shaped desk (two ikea desks put together)  with its own office chair and my listening chair in the middle of the room. Today my office chair broke and Im starting the look for a replacement. I would love to get not only a great office chair but also a chair that is comfortable enough to lounge in while I‚Äôm listening to music. It would free up a ton of space if I could find one chair for both purposes.

Also if anyone has tried it vs the Aeron B size, would appreciate some input on that."
,"I'm curious about this too. I have a 1st-gen Aeron size B and it's fine, especially for its age, but I think I'd like the frame flexibility and auto-adjusting of the Cosm, and the mid-back seems sort of like the next-gen Aeron (if you ignore the actual next-gen Aeron Remastered)."

Worth upgrading from my Staples Hyken to a used Leap V2?,"I've had this Hyken for 4-5 years now and while it's decent and functional (had to replace the pneumatic tube once though) it's starting to crack and show its age so I thought I might try to upgrade now. 

I think my biggest problem with these are actually the armrests, I'm not sure why but they are never at the same height even on the same setting and they are also too wide for me (168 cm, 67 kg). This causes me to basically always lean on my left side when sitting which doesn't seem good for posture. Really wish they had more adjustment options like width.

Honestly, I think the only reason why I tolerated the chair is because I move and fidget around a lot so I'm not stuck too long in an uncomfortable position. I basically adjust right armrest height like every few minutes. 

Been researching around and my main option seems to be the Leap V2 as it's the only thing I can find used at a relatively good price ($400-$450 CAD).

Would maybe miss the tilt lock function and headrest though on the Hyken.


Do you guys think I should pull the trigger and get the Leap V2?

Or should I stick it out with the Hyken until it is no longer usable?"
,"You will definitely feel a lot better with the steelcase leap. Either the version one or two, are both good choices. Try them both out. Version 1 has more padding. Your body will thank you for it. And give the other chair to a neighbor you don't like"
,"If you can, try out a Hayworth Zody with a forward tilt. We sell used ones at 325 USD, compared to 400 USD for a V2. But definitely try them out before you buy. You can always buy an aftermarket headrest for either. Good luck!"

,I‚Äôll add that I think it‚Äôs missing the lumbar support strap. Look online at how it is supposed to adjust. There‚Äôs a band that goes across the back and has two knobs to adjust. Ask them to show you a picture of the back to see.
"Looking for a high quality but ""conventional"" office chair for all-day use.","In terms of style I'm looking for something fairly conventional - the sort of thing which you'd find in an office with lots of adjustment levers for back angle and seat slide.  I'm unconvinced by the ""ergonomic"" chairs I've be able to try - the more clever they try to be the more there is something non-adjustable I don't get on with.

I'm really after guidance on something where the foam cushion won't compress to nothing from being sat on all day. I've learned soft memory foam is to be avoided.  I dislike mesh, particularly the inevitable unpadded frame.

High and straight-ish back for preference.  I like shoulder support and generally reduce lumbar support to its minimum when its adjustable.

In terms of size I'm about 5'9"" (slightly skewed to a long back and short legs) and ~196lbs

Edit: ironically one of the few chairs where I've found much discussion of the foam used is the secret labs range. If I didn't know they had such an emphasis on marketing I'd be vaguely tempted - the shape looks promising for me.  Are they really terrible, or just over-hyped for what they are?"

Looking for last resort budget recommendations for tall & heavier people,"Hi there,

&#x200B;

I've been looking at ergonomic chairs for a while now since my mistake of a purchase gaming chair gave up on me.

So far I've looked at getting the Mavix M5, the Sihoo M57, the Herman Miller Lino and the Herman Miller Mirra. The latter two on this list fall out of my preferred budget, but I am still looking at them in case of nice refurb options or sales.

In my search I've come to a conclusion that I like the Mavix M5 the most since people say it's really nice for tall people and well built for heavier people with the wide seat option.

However, I am still wondering if any of you may have other recommendations for me on a tighter budget. Looking at an absolute maximum budget of 500 euros.

It‚Äôs temporary, 3-4 days of back pain, then goes away for a while to return again and I feel it‚Äôs my chair. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck with this expensive chair now that is hurting my back. I have adjusted All the settings that I can think of but I still have this annoying returning back pain. I had zero issues with my leap v2 with back pain. It‚Äôs in my lower back. Any pro tips on how to address? I noticed a pillow in the lumbar area helps as I feel this chair has minimal lumbar support. Any aftermarket add ons like a lumbar support that helps? Thanks all."
,"I had issues initially with mine causing thigh and lower back aches. I seem to have resolved my issue by lowering the chair so my feet are on the ground. Initially, I was relying on a footrest to plant my feet."

,Noice!
,"Nice deal. Don't forget to protect those arm caps with a sock. I've had 3 pairs of these armpads break (!!!! 2 at a previous workplace which had a lot of sunlight, and one personal after leaving it idle in an apartment with low sunlight but some changes in temperature where the chair was sitting. I'm now pretty confident the rubber material Haworth uses, despite feeling super premium, does not like either sunlight, humidity or temp changes.

I would also caro to dust the chair every week, as it accumulates an ungodly amount of dust especially on the backrest frame, between the mesh and the plastic. You leave it there it won't ever come off xD.

It's an amazing chair but a bit sensible in those 2 departments is all."
"Leap V2 @ Ebay from Madison Seating, thoughts?","Considering buying one from them, (have been checking facebook marketplace constantly, doesn't seem like much happens out here) and for around less than $400 it seems like a pretty good deal, however it seems like it's quite the 50/50 from what I'm hearing from everyone online. Anyone here purchased one from them, or just have any thoughts ?"
,"I purchased one from them a couple months ago and don't think it's worth it. The frame says that it was manufactured in 2006, so it's a first gen with the top activated cylinder and worse (imo) arm pads. You can feel the staples in the bottom of the arm pads sticking up if you lean on them a bit. The teeth for the lumbar height adjustment are stripped out, so the lumbar doesn't stay where you put it. Everything is creaky. I'm past the return window but I'm going to sell this one and get one from Crandall with the thicker, brand-new foam. Hopefully that one will be in better and newer shape than this one."
,"Not here to poo-poo any refurbs or resellers, most of them are great and reputable/trustworthy people that will take care of you if you have any issues.  
Just keep in mind, $400/$1300 is 30.77% the cost of a new Leap chair from any authorized distributor of Steelcase. If you go this route, do not be surprised if you receive 30.77% of a product.  
In most instances, just like anything else, you get what you pay for. For example, as someone mentioned, getting a chair that is actually 16 years old but being advertised as new-open box. I wouldn't really call it a ""deal"", more of a ""compromise"".  


To the accountants out there, correct me if I'm wrong, but under the standard 10% straight-line depreciation rate for office furniture;

Assuming one buys a $1300 chair in 2006 with an expected life span of 16 years, said chair is only worth \~$241 today. Given that leaps were well under $1000 back in '06, I'd say its closer to \~$160 today. To me personally, $400 for that doesn't sound like a good deal at all, I'd be feeling rather ripped off.  


Bare with me here, but it would be loosely similar to driving past a Porsche dealership and seeing a 2022 model for $130k (1300), then getting an AD online for a ""New Porsche only 40k! (400)"" so you buy it thinking you're saving money just to receive a 2006 model that is only worth $16-24k (160-240) to any individual. But hey at least its the same Make/Model you were looking for right? Wrong."

,"**Brief comparison to the Fern**

Like probably everyone who subs here I had grown tired of paying like $350~400 for crappy Amazon/Staples chairs that last like 2 years at best and re-upping. I figured it was time to do some research on good chairs and buy one I could keep for a good long while. 

After extensive research, I settled on either a Steelcase Gesture, or a Haworth Fern. I'm gonna be honest at first glance, the Fern looked better for me. I really liked the look of the back design, and it just looked like a more traditional chair. Luckily for me, I live in a government town which means it's used/classified market is filled with chair sellers. I was able to go to local seller with a warehouse full of popular chairs and try them all. I also happen to live in a town with a Steelcase Canada distributor, so I went to the showroom. In hindsight, I wish I had tried an Amia. 

Anyways, moving on: I first settled on the Fern, and bought a fully loaded quick-ship executive one from a local used seller. During my demo testing, I felt the Fern felt best. Significantly better than anything else. Now during testing I tried to make it clear to the seller I really wanted to get a feel for the chair for a moment, but he was in ""salesman"" mode and kinda wouldn't stop talking, and kept trying to move me around to different chairs, so this may be what caused my initial impressions to be off, because after buying and owning a Fern for about 2 months or so, I pretty quickly decided I didn't like it at all...

I eventually sold it, and invested (at 2x the price mind you... :'( ) in a Steelcase Gesture. What sold me, as funny as it is, was a review from Jayz2Cents that he enjoys his Gesture. We looked about the same size (large man, above average height), so I figured I'd try my second option this time around, fully expecting not to love it, and probably resell it again also. I was about to cancel the order the same day they called me to tell me it arrived. 

Anyways, turns out Steelcase Canada doesn't seem to honour any of the same deals or service Steelcase does. The chair came with no return policy, and a much less satisfying warranty vs Steelcase USA's relatively strong policies. Anyways, after sorting out issues with my payment (they only accept 1 payment method for some reason...??) I put it an order for a Gesture with headrest with an estimated delivery time of 6 weeks, and informed the price of all SC chairs was going to increase another 25% and needed to order now if I wanted it.

13 weeks later (lol), I received my Gesture. Oddly it did not come in a box at all...it was shipped fully assembled, which I suppose was nice, but the seat itself was dirty from shipping. I'm an easy going guy though, so I shrugged it off.  

Onto the chairs, and my brief thoughts on both: 

**The Seatpan** was a big deal breaker for me. I found the Fern's seatpan VERY firm. And by firm, I mean I might as well be sitting on a wood board. I know people say the seat softens up, and I can attest mine did soften in the 2~3 months in my ownership, but I would definitely still not say the seat was particularly comfortable. The seat was also hard-edged which cut into my butt at the rear. The real issue though is that the Fern features an exaggerated waterfall at the front which I thought I'd like, but turns out I super mega hate because it makes the seat feel significantly shorter than it is, and I really enjoy my full leg being supported despite it being un-ergonomic. 

In comparison the Gesture's seatpan is on the firmer side, but not as firm as the Fern's. If the Fern's is a 9.5, the Gesture a 7. The shape is flared at the butt to support heavier people, and the front of the seat is sharpy rounded, so you feel the full length of the chair's seat. The seat also tapers inside the chair so no cutting into your backside.  

**The Back** on the Fern is probably it's best quality. It's soft, supportive, and very flexible. This is the primary reason I feared selling it because the back design simply works for how I use my PC and, well, everything else. My one complaint about the back was that the lumbar support, even on my model which didn't have *additional* lumbar was extreme. It might have actually been more comfortable to take the seat cover off which would tear out of it's railing from inward pressure and just sit against the plastic. 

In comparison, on my demo tests I didn't like the Gesture's back. I felt it was too similar to the Leap which I also didn't like because I felt it held me too upstraight. I took notes for the chairs I sat in, and in caps I wrote ""NOT LOUNGE CHAIRS"". Now that I have the Gesture in my house, I was wrong. Very wrong. Where the Fern's back is a contour, the Gesture's back is a scoop. The issue with the Gesture is that the whole chair feels weird if it's not calibrated to you. But when it is, the ""live-back tech"" is great. It's also a lot more flexible on my model. I'm not sure why I felt the demo chairs were so stiff. However, where the Fern flexes side to side, the Gesture flexes north/south, so keep that in mind. 

**The arms** are pretty easy, Gesture wins here but not for the reasons most think. I haven't heard any review mention this, which is wild because it became VERY apparent very quickly but the Fern's armwrests are like a slick foam/plastic. They are also angled downwards, which means my arms would regularly slide off if I leaned on one. This made the armwrests virtually useless unless I was reclining. 

I was also concerned about complaints that the Gesture's arms aren't moored; they roll about freely, which is true, but at least on my unit, they are quite secure. They require pressure to move. Those reports are likely units with untightened screws someplace. 

**Tilt** is about the same. Both very good. 

**Other peculiarities:** 

- There is a big difference in build quality. The piston doesn't even compress or creak when I sit down which did happen with the Fern. Nothing wobbles, or is loose. I did notice, however that the headrest is slightly uneven. 

- The Fern's rounded wheel base makes it annoying to rest your feet on the base, which I have a habit of doing often. 

- The Gesture's headrest doesn't bother me and I'd rather have it than not have it, but I do notice sometimes it can get in the way of my neck, but the pad is quite soft. My Fern didn't have a headrest, and I found it unnecessary on the Fern. 

- The lumbar on the Gesture can be moved out of the way so it doesn't bother me. The Fern's is obviously static and IMO as I said is too strong, even WITHOUT the factory lumbar addition.

- The Fern was much lighter than the Gesture. If you're the kind of person who expects to move your chair up and down stairs, or are concerned about moving in the future for whatever reason something to keep in mind is that the Gesture weighs about 40 lbs more.

PS. Please ignore my mess :) I do a lot at my desk, lol."
,It shipped from Steelcase w/ no box? Wtf

I‚Äôm finding a Herman Miller classic Aeron from 500-700 dollars on average. Saw really good reviews for this thing. Any advice or other suggestions (keeping in mind I‚Äôm pretty poor so going anything above is really hard?)"
,"Beyond the Herman Miller Aeron, there are plenty of other good ergonomic chairs. Take a look through the mega thread at the top of the sub. See if you can find a local liquidator or used office furniture shop.

,"I‚Äôve had low back pain on and off for years. I used an Aeron for about a year and a half and it was great. Offered excellent support and the recline was buttery smooth. But earlier in the year, I re-injured my low back and couldn‚Äôt sit comfortably in the Aeron because the mesh bottom applied pressure to a sensitive nerve. I also couldn‚Äôt sit with one leg up on the Aeron, which is a position that brought relief. After looking at alternatives, I bought a used Leap V2 from a local furniture surplus store for $200. The Leap‚Äôs padded fabric cushion is much more comfortable than the mesh from the Aeron. But the Leap doesn‚Äôt recline as smoothly or have as firm lumbar support as the Aeron. Overall though, I‚Äôm happy with the Leap v2. 

My recommendation to you is to find a local furniture surplus store and try out several options. Comfort is highly subjective and if this is going to be an investment, you should know firsthand what you‚Äôre investing into. $500-700 seems high to me. Check OfferUp and Facebook Marketplace - going rate for a used Aeron Classic in my area is approx $300-400."

Lumbar Pillow Strap,Hi! I have a lumbar pillow and am looking for a strap to attach it to my office chair. I cannot find a strap that doesn't include a pillow as well. Anyone know of anything?
Looking for a Office Chair (60kg / 178cm | 133lbs / 5'8),"Hey guys, I'm looking for a office chair right now and I'm not really sure which chair would fit my body type. My budget is around 500‚Ç¨ and I'm looking to get a used one. I already found Haworth Fern / Zody, Steelcase Think / Please V2 and a Herman Miller Celle (Dont really like the optics) in my area for that budget.

What chair (in general) would you recommend for my body type (60kg / 178cm | 133lbs / 5'8)?

Edit: I‚Äôm from Germany"
,i think the steelcase will be better than the Fern. Try out the Steelcase Leap V2. I tried a leap and fern at a store and definitely liked the leap better. Steelcase Amia might also work. Best way to confirm is to try them out at a store for yourself. There is a lot of personal preference that will come into play in the decision making
"Steelcase Leap v2, Haworth Fern or something else?","Hello everyone! Recently I've been getting chronic upper back pain with my current chair which I have to sit in 8+ hours a day for work. This always seems to be an issue for me with any chair I've tried over the years. For reference I'm a 5'6 105 pound male with a small frame.   


From my albeit limited research, I've narrowed my options down to either a Steelcase Leap v2 or a Haworth Fern. Ideally I would be able to try out both in a showroom but here in the UK I really don't have that luxury as there's very limited options for that, or at least anywhere even remotel close to me.  


What would you all recommend from your experience, or is there something else better out there that I've not considered?"
,I just got a Gesture and I like it a lot more than the Fern
,">or is there something else better out there that I've not considered? 

Is your workstation set up [ergonomically](https://res.cloudinary.com/hni-corporation/image/upload/d_allsteel-fallback-image_jy84n9.jpg/f_auto,q_auto/w_750,f_auto,q_auto,c_scale,dpr_auto/v1584044401/Allsteel/Brand/Brand%20Connect%20Assets/Showroom%20Maps/Ergo.png)? If not, then even the best chair won't help.

Another thing to consider for upper back pain specifically - using a split keyboard. These let you keep your hands further apart while typing, which helps you keep your shoulders from rounding forward, a strained posture."
"Haworth Fern, minimum height of the armrests from the seatpan","Can anyone that has a Fern measure for me the height from the seatpan to the top of the armrest? I need them to get out of the way, just like in the leap V2. Check image for reference (leap v2)

Thanks!

Tool for Steelcase Leap,Is there a specific tool or procedure to reinstall the Carrier Seat Plate on a Steelcase Leap?
,Pretty sure carrier plate isn't recommended to be removed. An Allen wrench can be used to pry and align one of the threaded holes. A longer bolt can be used to start one of the threaded holes then swap to the correct bolt after the other is started.

Sewing Chair,"Spouse currently uses a Serta Executive Big & Tall chair for her sewing work station (usually at one machine but needs to swivel back easily to use other machines) but has been experiencing butt fatigue recently.

Staples Hyken replacement 3D/4D armrests?,"So I‚Äôve had this chair for a while and it‚Äôs pretty uncomfortable but it‚Äôs still functional.

I think the main thing bothering me is that the armrests are too wide and are also strangely never at the same height (even on the same setting), So I was wondering if there any like custom replacement arms with 3D or 4D function that are compatible with this chair.

I am looking at upgrades too like a used leap v2 but I‚Äôm unsure because I can‚Äôt really try it out at my setup."

Steelcase Amia in Europe,"Hello guys,

&#x200B;

I had the chance to try an Amia and a Leap v2 and I kinda preferred the Amia.

&#x200B;

HAG Capisco Puls - footring or no footring,"So, I've pretty much decided on getting the Capisco Puls, I'm getting the 265mm lift version so I can perch on it in semi-standing position and I'm going back and forth on the footring? Anyone has one and never uses it or doesn't have one and wishes they got it?

I kinda get the impression that footring is mostly useful if you have an only standing desk, so you can both sit on the chair and perch on it - I have a motorized sit/stand desk so changing the height to sit with my feet on the floor is not a problem. Is that a correct assumption? Or are there other benefits to having it?"

Should I Wait Before Buying a Chair?,Hello! Recently I‚Äôve been looking into buying a chair but I noticed that chair prices seem to have skyrocketed wether because of supply chain issues or inflation. For example an IKEA Markus used to be $100-$200 and now it‚Äôs at least $270. Should I wait a little bit to buy a chair so the prices can maybe come down or are prices going to stay this high for a while?
,"Put it this way pal! The prices are always going to go up because of inflation. The longer you wait the more chance the price will go up higher and higher. Whereas if you buy it now, you can lock it in for the current price. A few years ago the same chair was probably under $100 but not anymore. $100 is not worth what it was worth 10yrs ago. If you have the money I‚Äôd say get it now or you can roll the dice and see if their prices would come down but I sincerely doubt it."
,"Maybe wait for Black Friday sales, but don't expect prices to drop to pre-inflation levels; that would be unprecedented."
,If you have time to wait you may want to consider keeping tabs on marketplace or offerup good deals pop up all the time. Meanwhile you can check for retailer sales.

Is Durian's Starry office chair a good choice?,"Hi guys, was checking out on few office chairs, Durian Starry and Maestro chairs caught my attention.

Also, not a fan of mesh back chairs before you suggest those :)"
Rugs to stop steelcase chairs from moving,"Ok, odd topic. We bought a steelcase chair for my father, who is recovering from a spinal injury. Chair is great. But we'd like to have a rug that offers additional support to prevent the caster wheels from moving too much when he gets up and down. They already don't move that much and the chair is great. But we do want a rug to provide extra support.

I suspect a deep or thick pile rug probably is the answer? Does anyone have experience with ""stiff' rugs to further minimize wheel movements and can suggest a rug brand or type of rug?

Thanks!"
,You can get wheels that have weight activated brakes.
,Do you know if the chair you purchased has hard casters or soft on it. Soft casters are used for hard surfaces like concrete and hardwood and don't roll as freely as a hard castor would on the same surface.

Chair ordered from Crandall did not come with Lumbar even though it stated that it would. Can a lumbar support be added to Gesture if it did not include one?,"Hi,

I ordered a Steelcase Gesture Authorized Return from Crandall Office.  I originally had ordered a Leap V2 from them, but the back warp was enough to where I could feel it pressing my left shoulder forward enough and developed some tightness on that side so I returned the chair and ordered the Gesture instead.

When ordering the chair, I made sure to get one with a lumbar support.  I have a bad lower back, which I why I specifically wanted a lumbar support, to force be into a better seating position.  I went on their site, and filtered chairs by ""Additional Lumbar Support"".  I ordered chair 4939 because it was a decent material, an ok color and, most importantly, was marked as having a lumbar support.  It looked to be a similar price tag as all the other Gesture returns with the lumbar support.

Link to the chair here: https://www.crandalloffice.com/shop/steelcase-authorized-factory-return-chairs/4939-steelcase-gesture-grade-a/


I just received the gesture today and assembled it.  When I went to adjust the lumbar, it was nowhere to be found, which is incredibly disappointing.  I'm not sure how this was missed.

Can a lumbar be easily added back onto the chair if it did not have one initially?  I don't love that I'm already going to have to disassemble the chair after just receiving it and also don't want to have to send back another chair to them.

Really disappointed right now.

Aeron Remastered vs Leap,"Users of Leap and Aeron. How is your ongoing experience? Do you regret or love your purchase? Is there anything you ignored initially which later turned out to the troublesome? 

Request your views/suggestion

I have been using my kitchen chair since the last 2 years which led to slight back pain. Hence, I am on a lookout for a good office chair. I have shortlisted leap and the Aeron. Subconsciously, I tend to keep 1 foot under the chair. Since I work from home, I am going to spend a lot of time on this chair.

I am based in India, 5‚Äô8‚Äô‚Äô and 175 pounds. I tried both the chairs in the showroom. My observation based on the brief 15-20 mins of the trial period.

Leap :

- I loved the way Leap hugs my back. My back feels supported and majority of my portion seemed to be in contact with the chair. 
- The fabric felt comfortable however I think it is a bit less dense. Not sure if it will cause heat because I was in it for 10-15 mins
- I could sit cross leg, 1 foot under the chair etc etc.

Aeron - Remastered - Size B:

- Felt premium and it has an amazing recline (better than leap) and I liked the soft armrests as well. 
- However, I felt that only the lower back of my body was in contact with the back of the chair. Mid back and upper back had minimal contact with the back. I tried the forward tilt but it brought me in an awkward position. 
- I could keep 1 foot under the chair but it was a bit uncomfortable due to plastic edge.

In India, once you purchase the chair, there is no free return policy. Since it is going to be an irreversible decision, I would like to seek your opinion."
,"If you sweat easily, the Leap V2 gets hot in warmer conditions. If so, I'd consider the Amia Air if it's accessible to you. Otherwise it's extremely comfortable and adjustable for all day comfort.

I enjoyed my time with the Aeron Remastered. The armpads are the best of any chair in my opinion, in terms of comfort. Posturefit SL lumbar support was very little and didn't do much for me. Very premium chair"
,"I have a Leap V2 and Aeron Classic.  The Leap is my daily driver, and I use the Aeron if I need a change of pace.  In my mind, a deciding factor between these two chairs is your sitting habits.  Do you ever sit cross legged or tuck a leg underneath?  If so, the Aeron is eliminated.  You can‚Äôt sit comfortably in it in those positions.  The Aeron demands that you sit with correct posture.  If you typically sit with both feet flat on the ground, then you should consider the Aeron.  It is a great premium chair if you intend to always sit correctly.

From what you told about yourself, I would recommend the Leap.  It sounds like it supports your back better, and would support many more sitting positions."
,Nice setup!
,Nice!  I've got an Amia in the same colour!  Such a comfy chair.
,Make you wanna say mama Amia!!! üçùüáÆüáπü§å
,Wow that blue looks really nice! Did you get it from Amazon? What‚Äôs your first impression‚Äôs of the chair? I‚Äôm considering the amia as one of my options too.
,"Nice!

Out of curiosity, what brand is the desk pad/mousepad? I looked forever for a gray one like that and it was surprisingly hard to find."
,"I would probably buy this if the backrest were flatter instead of curved at the top. My biggest gripe with the leap too, I want to be able to fully open my chest with a flat/narrow backrest that allows unrestricted range of arm motion. How is the Amia in this regard?"
,Do you happen to know which fabric that is? Buzz2?

Embody Headrest Update!,"Hey All,

Just release my full in-depth review of the Vantum Gaming chair. In it, I dropped an easter egg update of the HM Embody. 

The update: The near finished product is en route to me now :-) 

It's near finished because they want to know my thoughts and make any tweaks before release. 

[https://youtu.be/\_C1sPCOdkx4](https://youtu.be/_C1sPCOdkx4) in case you want to watch the Vantum review"
,"My man going into this review with one leg brace, but the chair looks so uncomfortable he's going to come out wearing a neck brace too."
,"The embody‚Äôs design doesn‚Äôt allow for a headrest like the aeron, where the head position allows for straight simple x and y axis movement. As far as I know (I‚Äôll really break it down when I get it) Since it needs to mount well behind the tip of the chair, the 2 movements won‚Äôt be independent of each other.

As for the backrest, the Amia is much more open, not nearly as rounded. It is LITERALLY the least offensive chair I‚Äôve EVER sat in. This is why it‚Äôs the queen of chairs for me. If you decide to pick up from Crandall or steelcase direct, please consider using my link! Helps the channel a LOT!! Let me know how it goes"

,"Wow. 2:43 in and I'm already shocked at the amount of forward-head, rounded shoulders posture the headrest forces you into. I imagine lots of upper shoulder/cervical pain complaints coming from people who try this chair."
looking for good affordable chair to use while gaming,I have been using a secret labs titan for the last 4 years and its starting to fall apart and is hurting my butt and lower back. I need a good replacement chair. looking to spend under $500 new or a used chair. so far i found a used Herman miller Aeron from 2015 thats been used but seller said its still amazing condition for $400. Would that chair be a good investment or does anyone have any better recommendations?
,Invest in your back health playa. Not a bad price for an aeron.
,"go to a staples and try a HYKEN! it's shockingly good for the price. but the 3d print head rest mod is essential imo. oh, also you need to be 5'8"" or under for best results, it you're taller, amazon GABRYLLY seems to be the big/tall with similar features."
,"If I were you I‚Äôd save up your money for a few more months and buy a refurbished CA from Crandall Office Furniture. They replace just about everything apart from the mesh, gives you a 12yrs warranty, and a 30 day return policy. It is of course around $650 but at least you will have a chair to use for the next 12yrs with this purchase. $400 is a good price for a 2015 CA BUT unless you can verify the age of the chair for sure then it‚Äôs basically his word. Ask him for a photo of the label underneath the chair to verify the age of the chair even though you can take those labels off from another chair and put it on his chair but I doubt it. 

If you buy from COF you are guaranteed to have a working chair for 12yrs whereas the $400 Aeron could break a day or a week or a month or a year after you buy it so you‚Äôll never know. Spend a little more for the warranty is a good idea."
Bowery Chair by Laura Davidson Discontinued (Similar to Sayl),"I've had my Bowery for over two years and can confidently say it is far more comfortable than the Herman Miller Sayl or any similar chairs I tested. I've recommended it to half a dozen friends who also purchased and loved it. Now that my girlfriend is working from home, I thought I'd surprise her with a finished office for Christmas. I checked the Laura Davidson site today and found the Bowery and any references to it were removed. I reached out to their support and they told me it was discontinued indefinitely. 

From what I could tell, it was one of their best performing lines that had a TON of earned marketing on YouTube and other sites. The only thing I can think of is Herman Miller threw a Cease and Desist at them they couldn't fight.

I couldn't find any information on this elsewhere, so I just wanted to share it with the community. 


Here's how the conversation with support went:

LD Support:

>Thanks for reaching out! So sorry about this! The Bowery chairs were discontinued and won‚Äôt be returning. 

Me:

>Thanks for the reply! That's too bad, everyone I've introduced it to loved it. Is there any way to get one of the remaining stock if there are a few stragglers in the warehouse?  Or, even, a way to buy the parts individually if there's legal reasons the whole chair can't be sold?
>
>Any help or direction would be amazing. It seems like this was a very recent development so if there's any chance at all to get another, I'd love to make it happen.

LD Support:
>I definitely agree and we were sad to see it go too. We don‚Äôt have any left at all or parts that we could sell I‚Äôm afraid. üò¢
>
>Sorry to hear about that other chair experience. If anything changes in the near future though I‚Äôll let you know right away!"
,"Thank you for posting this! I started perusing this sub because about a month ago, one of the casters fell off my Bowery. Closer inspection shows that the frame is cracked where that caster attaches. I was considering filing a warranty claim, but if they don‚Äôt have any replacement parts, it seems it won‚Äôt be worth the effort.
And now I‚Äôm in the analysis paralysis phase of choosing a new chair so I‚Äôm still very carefully using the broken one. It is really comfy and supports my frequent cross-legged sitting so well!"
,I‚Äôm on the hunt for a chair and like you said this one was spoken of pretty highly. Went online to check prices and was confused because I couldn‚Äôt find it for sale anywhere. This post explains why though!
Office or Gaming,"Looking for a replacement for my existing chair which is more of a gaming chair.

I am assuming that no one has come out with a combo office/gaming chair yet?

If not then I guess I am swaying more towards a gamer. I have searched most of the retailers here in Canada and there are a few that are getting some pretty bad reviews. Then of course I am blasted with Secretlab, Secretlab, Secretlab, I looked at their Evo 2022 and there seems to be zero curve to the back of the chair, it's straight down, like no lumbar support unless it's built in. 

So has anyone purchased a chair say within the last year or so and found it a really comfy, great quality chair?"
,A good chair is a good chair. There is nothing specific about a racing car seat that somehow makes you a better gamer.
,You're looking for an ergonomic gaming chair? Check out this absolute unit: https://bodybilt.com/product/gx7/
,if you want a chair for the looks and not for the pain-free qualities then yes you can get a $150 gaming chair.  If you want one that is a hybrid and is a top 5 chair but not the best for sitting then that would be the aeron.
2 cents on btod,"I've purchased a chair from BTOD in the past that ended up having cracks where the seat and back rest met. Great customer service let me have a full refund on the chair even past its return date. No shipping back items are required. 

I most recently purchased a leap v2 refurb after seeing how popular they were.   After assembly, I sat in it and the height immediately sank. BTOD has a pretty large knowledge base on youtube I looked up the chair and they had a troubleshooting video. The video showed troubleshooting for the top-activated cylinder and no solution for the model I have. 

To compare, I have an original Steelcase leap v2 at work that's over 6 years old with no sinking issues or general issues with the cylinder. As for the refurbished back rest, seat, and armrests, they feel great and I hope they last just as long. 

Customer service has been fast to respond and they will send me a new cylinder. Their customer service is great, but my experience with their products has been a bit Iffy. 

Given their customer service, I have a bit more confidence in their 12-year warranty, it's just kind of a bummer to receive a chair that's DOA. 

Hopefully the replacement does the trick, but if not, I'll sadly return this chair.

Overall. Great customer service but I personally have had a less-than-ideal time with the chairs I received."
,"u/ryanatbtod , take a bow..."
,"I‚Äôve been a biz customer of BTOD for years. Tbh, it‚Äôs a mixed bag. I‚Äôd say 30% of the chairs I order in have some kind of issue. Most commonly it‚Äôs a cylinder that wasn‚Äôt installed correctly or a DOA cylinder. I‚Äôve had a few busted hard plastic parts.

I‚Äôve never had any issues with upholstery ü§ûor its longevity, and the chairs show up looking like new. 

Usually BTOD has what I need at a fair price and that good upholstery work is harder to find than you‚Äôd think. They‚Äôre quick to fix the other errors, always.

Do I wish they‚Äôd implement some QC before they box up a chair? Heck yes. It‚Äôs hard to sell clients on used office furniture‚Ä¶really bad when it shows up broken."

Ekornes Stressless Office Chair Owners; worth it or a hard pass?,Currently own a Herman Miller Embody and it‚Äôs server me well and is very supportive - I wish it was just a little more padded. Curious if the Stressless Office Chairs are worth the price as I consider a new office chair.
,"Where are you located if you don't mind me asking?  
We work very closely with Ekornes/Stressless as well as their sister companies IMG and Fjords. I would like to think they have a bit of a niche target demographic but the customers who seek their products really seem to like them and don't regret their purchases. I dont think their products are overhyped by any means, but definitely tailored to a specific type of customer that can afford them. To be honest we rarely see people interested in their office chairs, mostly the recliners and sofas. But the chairs are definitely comfortable and the authentic Norwegian top grain leather which is where most of the cost comes from.  


I ask your location as we have one of the largest (if not the largest) in house showrooms in the country for Stressless brand furniture. It amazes me to hear people driving 8+ hours to see the products in person and ""try before you buy"" so regularly.

Can you Purchase Steelcase Leap v2 Arms on their Own?,"Hi! I've been in the market for a chair that is much kinder to my spine,  scanning through the usual second hand stops. I found some Steelcase Leap v2s being liquidated within a reasonable distance from me, but they're the armless versions. I'd like to say the arms would be fairly important to me. I did a little looking around online and I'm finding mostly just options for replacing the pads and cushions of the chair, but not a full arm assembly upgrade.

Is it possible to upgrade easily, and if so, would anyone have any suggestions for where I'd be able to find the arm assembly for purchase in it's own? Don't wanna buckle down until I can secure the arms.

I'll keep my eyes peeled as I look around as well, but I thought it was worth a shot asking here as well. Thanks!"

Leap v1 to Haworth Zody?,"Had my leap v1 for 8 years but it's beyond the point of economical repair and to be honest I never really liked it all that much it would give me tailbone pain.

I'm unable to try any chairs due to where I live in the UK. I see a refurbished Zody for ¬£350 I'm tempted to take a stab in the dark at, but not sure. Fern looks better for me but no refurbs for that chair anywhere (too new?) 

I'm 5'11 and 150lbs."
,Go for it IMHO
,Zody is a very nice chair with lots of adjustability. A very highly rated chair in my opinion. Sometimes in the Uk you can find good chairs delivered with ebay such as a steelcase Amia or Knoll generation. Up to you
,"Even if your V1 is old you are comparing a Mercedes with a voltswagen. 

Leap is usually compared to the fern. I would check there first."
,I love the fern but not a huge fan of the Zody.  I'm surprised you didn't like the leap but you gotta go with what works for you.  Have you tried a mesh bottom seat?  What about the leap do you think was the issue - the bottom cushion or something else?
,"Just a word of warning to others: After weeks of deliberating between a new Leap (v2), a refurb v2, or the Fern, I decided to spring for the new Steelcase. Unfortunately, when I took it out of the box, I immediately noticed the back-rear brace (connecting the back to the seat) was completely cracked off. It's now been 4 days since I filed a claim and I'm still waiting to hear back if they're going to do anything. I might be spoiled, but I would expect better quality and better customer service for a chair this expensive. I'm not sharing this so much to complain but to suggest to others that I would recommend going with a refurb where you know a real human inspects it before it ships out, and there's a smaller customer-service-oriented team to support issues."
,"Looks like the shipping carrier dropped the box one too many times. 

Highly doubt that they shipped it to you broken.

,"From my experience, you will get a replacement 100% and keep the broken one as parts donor.  I know that it's very inconvenience for getting a chair arrived broken and waiting for replacement. On Steelecase side, maybe better packaging material/method or carrier to ensure the chair arrives in one piece as intended. Happy customer better PR!"

,"For many chairs, particularly less expensive models, proper chair fit depends on whether you're typing/mousing a low desk or keyboard tray with your feet on the floor, or a standard ~29""-high desk with a footrest. Few chairs have sufficient height range for both positions for shorter users. For example, the Friant Ignite only sits low (lower than its specs suggest) while the Staples Ayalon only sits high (higher than its specs suggest).


Some decent budget chairs for short folks (5'2"" and under):

* Friant Ignite (low)

* Friant Tango (low)

* Staples Carder (low)

* used Knoll Chadwick (low)

They're pretty popular on the very-gently-used market (ie: 6-12 months old), so see if there's a used office furniture place somewhere near you if the sticker price is of concern.  That would probably bring it within your $800 range.  I picked up two 6 month old 2020 models that were fully loaded and never been sat in for about $850CAD, so you would have some luck at that price.

Best high-end ergonomic chair for reclining,"Hello,

I'm looking to buy a high-end chair (~$1000-1500) from either Herman Miller or Steelcase (or any other high-end brand). Been doing a lot of research myself but I noticed a lot of their most popular chairs, like the HM Aeron/Embody don't have headrests.

Does this subreddit have any recommendations on high-end chairs that are good for people who like reclining back like me?

I guess my criteria are

1. Comfortable headrest.

2. Armrest that can come close to the body, and back enough, so that they're there even when reclining back.

One chair that I looked that potentially fits is the Steelcase Leap v2, with the headrest, but most reviews I saw says the headrest is not comfortable. Would love to hear opinions from this subreddit.

Thank you."
,"I have the SteelCase gesture with headrest. It reclines plenty for me with variable tension. The headrest is very adjustable. You won‚Äôt get deep recline with even armrest unless they‚Äôre connected to the back. The gesture armrests are extremely mobile though, so they‚Äôll likely do the job nicely."
,"Have you looked at the Leap WorkLounge?

The armrests make it clear it's more lounge than work so it's likely not something you want for 8+ hours working but with the other aspects that make the Leap a top ergonmic chair it could be the right fit."
,"FYI the 3rd party Atlas Headrest for the Aeron is one of the best out there. It's pricy but you simply can't say the Aeron doesn't have a good headrest option.

The *Humanscale Freedom* has the armrests you want, and its dynamic headrest ensures your viewing angle remains the same throughout the recline. But I highly recommend testing before buying because Humanscale chairs tend to be love it or hate it.

Another high-end chair with the armrests you want is the *Haworth X99 Task Chair with Headrest*. I was impressed when I tested it at an office liquidation shop.

A couple mid-tier chairs with headrest and the armrests you want - the *SIDIZ T80* and the *Knead KC01*."
,"Aeron Remastered w/ Atlas fabric head rest. Trust.. I've tried all the steelcase and a bunch of other chairs recently but that combo is the best imo.

,"I recline a lot in my Logitech Embody when in not working in front of my desk. I put my feet up on a stool and I love rocking back and forth on it because it‚Äôs so smooth and it feels like gods two hands are holding me up.

I don't want to spend too much so I'm considering used:

Think V1 ($140)

Haworth Zody ($200)

Any other models I should look at? I know people say the Think leans too easily which is why I think it might actually work for me - I'm way too light to lean in any chair i've tried without pushing myself back with my legs"
,"Steelcase Amia might also be a contender. Btw, most chairs should have a knob or something to adjust the tension of the recliner. Most of them can be loosened so much that just leaning a bit on the backrest will cause it to recline. Even with your weight I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd have any issues if you adjust it right. 

You might want to look at Humanscale Liberty/Diffrient too but they‚Äôre less popular and probably harder to snatch one at a good price."

>I may need a size C as I'm 6' and 330lbs.

I would not even touch a Classic Aeron if I were you. 330 pounds exceeds the weight capacity of the Classic Aeron. You'll likely snap the frame in half. Classic Aeron's (especially pre-05) already have issues with the seats cracking without someone exceeding the weight limit. 2008 Aeron's ""fixed"" the issue but that being said I still have come across post-05 Aeron's with cracked seat frames."

Any office chairs with seat depth greater than 47cm/18.5 inches?,"I am tall 6'6 with the majority of my height coming from my legs. From my research, I haven't managed to find an office chair with a seat depth adjustment greater than 47cm/18.5 inches.

I am currently using an old Ikea Markus which I bought 10 years ago. This chair has a seat depth of 47cm. Other chairs that I have researched all don't have as deep seat depths as this i.e Herman Miller Embody, Steelcase Amia, Haworth Fern and RH Logic 400. It appears 47cm/18.5 inches or below is the normalized standard when it comes to the maximum adjustable seat depth. Only the Steelcase Leap V2 has a seat depth of 47cm/18.5 inches. I plan to try this chair but I am concerned the backrest of the chair will be too short. I am used to a tall backrest such as that on the Ikea Markus so we shall see if the Leap V2 is suitable for me.

Now the Embody is definitely smaller than it looks in real life but the seat pan is the widest I‚Äôve ever sat in because it‚Äôs adjustable and I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2. That being said, the Embody fits me perfectly seat wise but the backrest is not that long or high. I don‚Äôt think any of the chairs you mentioned has a high back. You may want to look into a size C Aeron or a plus sized Leap V2."
,Did you check out the Knoll life chair? Seat pan depth rang of 39.5-49.5cm. Speaking for my self a 6' 280lbs man love my life chair fits me well as a larger person.
,"The chair is too large - your knees are hitting the front edge of the seat. The backrest appears to be designed as a mid-back for a much longer torso than yours; the backrest's lumbar curve is too high takes up half of your back, whereas it should just fit in the small innermost curve of your lower spine. My point is, of course this chair is uncomfortable and causing you pain in the long run!"
,"Hi. I am also digital artist. I am also short. I also have back pain in lower left side. First I had a staples mesh chair which just made my back pain worse. I started to do a lot of research in standing desks and ergonomic chairs. 

I watched a lot of BTOD review videos on ""best chair for short person,"" I'm 4'11 and the person was 5'2, which meant this person could still touch the floor with whatever chair they picked. But what I learned from those videos is that you have to go to the chair place and sit in the chairs to try them out. Some people like firm chairs,some people like soft chairs. We tested out steelcase chairs but they were too expensive. I liked the steelcase series 2 when I went to sit in it but not the price.  I was able to find an office chair at a used office supply shop.

I ended up with a weird/early model of the leap v1. It's been good for my back, but I do have a bit of neck pain now (probably from not moving around as much as I should). It's a firm chair, which might not work for everyone. My bf got the steelcase amia at discount which is too soft for me. 

I can touch the floor at the lowest setting. Very rare when you're as short as we are. 

My best advice is try out an office furniture store and see what fits you best. I got to sit in a Steelcase Gesture but I really couldn't see myself working in it for 8+ hours a day. They didn't have any herman millers I could try there. 

I don't think people take us vertically challenged people into account as much. We don't want kid stuff. And some stuff is designed with people who have longer spines.

Also the fully desk I got goes down pretty low too to fit my height. It's been fine so far. Not an advertisement for these companies. Just saying my experience as someone on the shorter spectrum. 

Anyway, I hope this helped."
,"That chair is way too big for you. Your shoulders should be above the back of the chair, but they're not even close. This chair was made for people much taller than you.

And the legs... same story. Your legs are short, so you are forced to sit forward on the chair in order for your knees to hang down. You should have your butt slightly farther back on the seat, but if you try that, your legs won't clear the front edge of the seat.

So yeah, wrong chair for the body dimensions. Try a Herman Miller Aeron size A"
,"There are multiple issues here.

First, there are the external issues.  Having an excellent ergonomic setup does not prevent you from developing back pain.  Back pain arises in part from atrophy and long term sitting.  Since long term sitting is enabled by a high quality seat, your seat is also making it possible to atrophy if you start sitting more than you did before you got the seat.  

Second, people are right that your seat is not fitting you adequately.  People are commenting on seat pan depth, but that's not the worst part, especially given the footrest.  Worth fixing though.  The more serious issue in my opinion is that your lumbar support is  hitting too high on the back; it needs to be lower.  It's proper position is lower than you think - it should be below the lumbar curve.  This is especially problematic given that you are sitting in a slightly reclined position, as there is more unsupported weight than if you are totally upright.

I think you are also sitting too far back from the desk.  The most ergonomically sustainable space (from an exhaustion / body stress perspective) is closer to the core.  If it's not supported by the table, you cannot draw in that area, so it's functionally less useful.  If you have to reach further on a regular basis, it's less sustainable.

There is probably a left/right bias on the support of your drawing hand that is creating a left/right stress on your body.  

Your armrests are too high.  You may develop nerve pain in your shoulders if you maintain this position for long periods."

Don‚Äôt see V2 on website but this one comes up whenever I search for it. Or any other suggestions on chairs for 1300? Thank you!
,"Steelcase makes the leap, if you're buying direct from Steelcase, they just call it the Leap. There's no indicator of version since they only sell the latest revision. 

If you're buying used, refurbished or whatever, the version will be listed since it's been in production since 1999 and there have been two major versions. The Leap V1 was manufactured until 2007 when they redesigned the chair and made the ""v2"" which has been in production since then. There are some minor differences from year to year as well. Source: researched this over time, sitting in a used leap v2 right now.

So, is this direct from Steelcase? Looks like it based on the price. Note that many authorized distributors can provide a coupon as well for around 10% if you ask nicely. None of them sell direct to consumer here where I am - all B2B and large projects. That may not be the case where you're located and they may be able to work with you locally.

Besides buying online from Steelcase, you can buy from authorized online dealers as well like Amazon, Wayfair, etc. All listed on the website. 

If you're interested in buying used - lots of furniture stores nearby to me sell them. Usually they're in good shape. You can also buy online from reputable refurbishers like Crandall and BTOD that provide transparency on what they do during the refurbishment. Crandall is also an authorized factory returns seller. 

Again, all information I found when trying to buy a chair myself recently. If you want suggestions on different chairs, you may need to provide more detail like height/weight which can determine a general idea of what might fit you well."
,Crandall Office Furniture is your best bet versus a new one!
,"Go to Crandall and buy a refurbished chair for $850-$900. Get the thicker back and seat pad.

My frame was a couple months old, and had only a dent or two throughout. The thicker seat pad is very beneficial."
,Try to find a local reseller (they are on Steelcase's website) and check what price you can get ordering the exact same thing. I saved about 10-15% (not counting shipping which I no longer needed) doing that.
,"If you spend significant time in your truck getting an ergonomic office chair may not fully solve your issue. Poor seating ergonomics applies to everywhere someone sits. If it is a short time, say a fast food restaurant, you aren't likely to have long term negative impacts from it. But say you spend a few hours in your truck each day and it is injuring you, having a perfect chair when you aren't in the truck won't fully solve the issue as you need time away from the source of the injury to heal."
,Take the advice that some are giving you and buy the refurb chair from Crandall with the thicker pad. I paid full price for a brand new Leap Plus (i'm thicc) and my tailbone fucking kills me if I sit for long periods of time.
,"Crandall like other people suggested, or try to find a used one locally if you‚Äôre in a big city by searching Craigslist and FB for just like ‚Äòchair‚Äô and you might get lucky!"

,"Never buy Leaps new.

It's the most popular chair in the world. You can find thousands of them used for like $200."

,"Just bought a remanufactured Leap v2 from Crandall, paid $600. Chair is amazing. Check them out first"
,I suggest not buying directly from the website and contacting authorized dealers around your area for a quote. Generally you will get a bunch better price as opposed to buying on the website. I just picked up a new Aeron fully loaded for $900 + tax doing the same thing after reading another Reddit post suggesting to reach out to dealers.
,Bro I bought my refurbished steelcase leap v2 local for $200 from a local furniture dealer who has a storage locker full of them. Look around on Facebook marketplace.
,"I bought a steelcase gesture a few weeks back and I highly recommend investing in a SC chair. Already my posture is better with the lower back support and back pain has subsided. If you are doing a lot of typing (i'm a programmer), I recommend the gesture as it's 4d style arm rests can be set exactly level with your desk for more support of your elbows."
,Just don‚Äôt get an Aeron. Most overrated chair in the world. I sold my Aeron and now have a Think and Leap (which I bought after trying them out in a store). Infinitely better
,Where are you located?
,"Yeah, don‚Äôt buy a new one, I‚Äôve seen these in great condition for $200 on Facebook marketplace. I bought a like new Steelcase Amia that was a month old for $15 which is $900 new."
,"Yeah, don‚Äôt buy a new one, I‚Äôve seen these in great condition for $200 on marketplace. I bought a like new Steelcase Amia that was a month old for $15 which is $900 new."
,"Lots of good advice here. But my somewhat blunt response would be if you're unfamiliar with the chair so much that you're not sure where to buy it, you probably could use more research into the wide world of office chairs, and big brands such as Haworth, Steelcase, Herman Miller. As well as buying used, refurbished, and what suits you personally based on size/weight and sitting preferences."

BIG GUY FROM EUROPE NEEDS HELP FINDING A CHAIR,"Hi as I mentioned in the title I am a very big guy (200kg/440lbs) living in Europe and I cant find a big enough chair for me. My parents bought me my current chair probably 5-6 years ago and although it was a really good chair (I used it everyday for at least 4h a day) and it lasted until now, it is starting to wobble and squick. I recently started working from home and am behind my desk 12+ hours a day so I need a chair that is stable and confortable while still being able to move around.  My current chair has a seat width of 63cm or 25 inches and I think that going smaller than that wont fit me. If you know of anywhere I can buy a chair like this for less than 500 euros (mind you the chair I currently have was about 200) I would really appreciate your help.

Thanks to anyone willing to help me and if any more information are needed I will happily answer to your questions in the comments."

Ergonomic chair,"Hello! I was approved for a Steelcase Zamia or Think through a reasonable accommodation request with my employer. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 185 lbs, with DDD in my cervical and lumbar spine as well as bone spurs in my lumbar spine and L4 nerve impingement. Which one should I go for do you think?"
,Edit: Amia
,"I have an Amia Air at work and I purchased a BTOD refurbished fabric back Amia for my home office (with the supplemental seat pad). I haven‚Äôt sat in a Think but I did internet-study it vs the Amia and some other chairs before I bought my Amia.

I think it might come down to either the lumbar or the recline mechanism for you.

Amia‚Äôs lumbar is part of an extensive back support mechanism, whereas the lumbar on the Think is a small bar/band in the lumbar region. I‚Äôve seen reviews where the Think lumbar slides out of position throughout the day. Amia‚Äôs lumbar isn‚Äôt especially prominent, but I find it supportive and stable. Note that the Amia‚Äôs lumbar support is easy to remove if you find it uncomfortable.

For recline, Think has a 3 position back stop (up, halfway, full recline) without tension adjustments whereas Amia has adjustable tension with a ‚Äúlock upright‚Äù lever. I recommend looking up videos on these features to see which you prefer. Personally I think the Amia takes the cake here.

Amia also inherits some character from the Leap in its flexible frame at the thighs and upper back. I have not seen any reviews mention such a feature on the Think. This flexibility helps you feel supported but free when moving around in the Amia (vs reports of something like an Aeron‚Äôs rigidity locking you into one posture).

Reviews seem to indicate the seats are fairly similar. I only purchased the extra seat pad on my refurb Amia because I had no way to guarantee the standard pad would still last many more years for me after whatever it might have been through with previous owners. My Amia Air at work has the OEM pad and has held up just fine for the two years I‚Äôve had it.

So obviously I‚Äôm in the Amia‚Äôs corner, but if you do lean toward the Think, the BTOD folks recommend a fabric back. They say the back supports on the mesh version are uncomfortable."
"New to Home Office, looking for help finding a chair.","Hey folks,    
I've recently moved to 100% remote work.  Between work and play I can spend up to 10 hours at the desk.  I've been using a cheap Atrix chair and it's just not standing up to the job.    I like to adjust how I'm sitting, a lot.  I'm talking desk height, armrests, chair height, chair lean and recline.    I'm about 220lbs and broad shouldered, my current chair causes pressure on my shoulders :("
,"I don't game but went with a Mavix M9 for my own remote work because it's basically got all the same features as the X-Chair X-Tech for half the cost. That being said, if your issue is pressure on your shoulders, have you tried lowering your armrest height?"
,"You really should never be adjusting your chair height. Your height is fixed and your ideal seat height is also fixed. 

Typically chairs favored here are in the $1000+ range new from Steelcase, Herman Miller and Haworth."
,"Hey there! I'm no expert but I also have been doing a lot of research trying to find a good chair. A lot of it depends on your budget, as i'm sure you saw pretty quickly, a good high end chair can be very expensive ($1200+ on average). 

It's worth noting that all these chairs are fully adjustable between height, arm adjustments (4D, So 4 Directional adjustment between height, pivot, depth and width). And the Fern has a forward seat tilt that allows you to angle the back of the seat up. They also all have really good warranties, although the ranges differ.

Some good companies that I see recommended a lot are [Herman Miller](https://store.hermanmiller.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwwL6aBhBlEiwADycBILuh1jU23mL7WNXKpZOQj-73c_Xl3r_NVGdsb491f6vVqSwOS7HcQRoCgNwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) , [Steelcase](https://store.steelcase.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=search-br&utm_content=text&utm_term=steelcase&gclid=CjwKCAjwwL6aBhBlEiwADycBIDHQOXIwIx4G5z9SCoZi7n1AO-GzlycLZP448srVFQzMiSbLpJsTFhoCfmgQAvD_BwE) , and [Haworth](https://store.haworth.com/?gc_id=10208849186&h_ad_id=570712208813&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=search&gclid=CjwKCAjwwL6aBhBlEiwADycBIFmG9_bbfELjOIyMlYA25OyL-AwADi3UdApooC9YNB3g0TT1RuA66xoCdusQAvD_BwE) . 

Of those three companies, these are pretty commonly suggested chairs:

[Steelcase Leap](https://store.steelcase.com/seating/high-performance-seating/leap?cclcl=en_US) \- This is widely regarded as one of your best, safest picks. It does just about everything you'd want out of a high quality office chair very well.

[Steelcase Amia](https://store.steelcase.com/seating/high-performance-seating/amia?cclcl=en_US) \- Can be seen as a little bit more ""basic"" compared to others, but I hear a ton of praise for it's **seat quality**, so if you're looking for seat comfort above all else, check this out

[Herman Miller Aeron](https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-chairs-aeron/aeron-chair/2195348.html?lang=en_US) \- Another very popular chair, I see this reccomended a lot from Herman Miller

[Herman Miller Embody](https://store.hermanmiller.com/home-office-chairs/embody-chair/4737.html?lang=en_US) \- This ones kind of a famous pick, but it's on the more expensive side. It trades cushion-y seats and backrests for an extremely flexible and supportive ""pixel"" system that meshes very well to your body.

[Haworth Fern (Digital Knit)](https://store.haworth.com/products/fern-digital-knit-office-chair) and [Haworth Fern Mesh Knit](https://store.haworth.com/products/fern-mesh-office-chair) \- These are roughly the same chair, however the back rests are built differently. The Digital Knit I've seen to be a bit more cushiony and comfortable, with the Mesh Knit being more breathable. 

&#x200B;

HOWEVER!

If you are on a budget and are interested in the Steelcase Leap specifically, please do yourself a favor and check out [Crandall Office](https://www.crandalloffice.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwwL6aBhBlEiwADycBIOAFbrh1SP8O8GW-dnj0GxCpoXucCDPetdYLlzp5SMMqalLhWeE0phoCuLcQAvD_BwE) , they are an exceptionally high quality chair refurbishment company.

,I work from home full-time as well and I‚Äôve been using a Logitech Embody for almost 2yrs now. I sit in my chair 12+ hours per day 7 days a week and I have no discomfort whatsoever. I would definitely recommend this chair however it is one of the most expensive chairs out there right now but it‚Äôs worth the investment if you can swallow the price of $1795.
,"Considering the latest-newest of the Leap V1's are over 15 years old now, its safe to say any in this condition (that arent covered in dust and cobwebs) are going to be ""fake"" or ""moded"" in some way.

The base immediately looked off to me at first glance but I actually forget what these ancient chair's base options even were back then so cant say with 100% certainty. Also fabric looks reupholstered as the left-right top of the seat back are uneven.   


I'm no resale expert when it comes to these chairs so someone else can hopefully chime in on its value. My gut is telling me this chair would not be worth 330 based on the numbers I've seen thrown around here. Hope this helps.

Can anyone offer some advice on a ergonomic chair?," Hi, been lurking on this subreddit for a few days looking at various suggestions for a decent chair around my budget of $400ish.

For some context, I am 5'10 and around 127 pounds dude. I basically sit in front of a computer 8-12 hours a day.

I    currently use Gabrylly Ergonomic Mesh office chair for the past year,    few reasons I don't like the chair is a mixture of the mesh seating   that  hurts my bony ass after a while and I also feel like the seat and    backrest are really far apart so I have to scoot real far back making   me  feel like I'm overextending my bottom.

I'm    looking for a chair that is isn't a mesh seat, cause sometimes I do   like to sit cross legged on chairs too. I am okay with any backrest   material.

From my own research I found these 2 chairs around my budget

Sidiz T50

Haworth Soji Mesh Office Chair Essential

From    the reviews they seem pretty good, esp the Sidiz T50 (amazon  reviews),  however I wasnt  able to find much info on the Haworth Soji  Mesh, other  than some videos, but most of them don't talk mention their  height or  weight.

I really appreciate any kind of insight or other chairs that might be good for me around that price range!"
,"The safest and most commonly recommended chairs will be the Herman Miller Aeron/Embody, Steelcase Leap/Gesture, and the Haworth Fern.  These can be found used for what you're looking for and even cheaper. An upholstery and pad redo could cost around $200 for the Leap.

You can rule out the Herman Miller chairs because you don't like mesh and the Embody is thinly padded.

I am not sure about the Gesture but I hear good things. Haven't sat in one in a very long time.

Never tried a Fern either but the seat is more padded than a Leap. If you buy one used that has the pad broken in a bit I hear it's very comfortable. 

The Leap V2 used could be found around $300, then you can replace the pads for another $200.  It would be over budget a bit but you'd have basically a new chair."
,"SIDIZ chairs are overrated (see review videos by Ahnestly and BTOD), and the Haworth Soji isn't really worth buying without the adjustable lumbar support and 4D armrests.

Given your very slim build, the following factors are particularly important when selecting an office chair: (1) a softer seat, (2) lumbar support that doesn't poke your spine, and (3) armrests that adjust inward.

With those factors and your budget in mind, I recommend the [Staples Ayalon](https://www.staples.com/ayalon/directory_ayalon). You can test it at practically any Staples store."

Need parts (or hacks) for discontinued chair: Steelcase Please,"My Please (don't know if V1 or V2, it was made in 2002) needs a new gas cylinder but I haven't been able to find any, and a local Authorized Steelcase dealer/refurbisher told me that the Please and its parts are discontinued and I'm SOL (paraphrased).

Does anyone know where I can find such a thing? Are there off-brand parts manufacturers? The rest of the chair is in great shape so it would be ridiculous to trash it just for this. Even if it was at a fixed but higher height, that would be cool. Is there a way to replace the cylinder with just a simple tube of some kind, or lock a busted cylinder at a particular height and sacrifice adjustability?"

Comfortable WFH chair for a WIDE person?,"Hi, peeps.

My chair is wearing out and I'm looking to replace it. The biggest concern I have is I'm a wide person, and many seats seem too small. My current chair has a 23"" wide seat and it's just wide enough for me.

I need a chair that can hold 400 lbs every day for a WFH person who also PC games. Preferably one with a quality base on it. the one I have now is a steel base, but the casters have broken off.

Thanks in advance!"
,Leap v2 plus!
,"If you're on a budget, check out the Staples Driscott."
,"The [Sitmatic Goodfit Big and Tall Fabric High-Back Chair](https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/9179997/Sitmatic-Goodfit-Big-And-Tall-Ergonomic/) is just the right width with a 24""-wide seat and armrest that adjust outward if necessary. It's also mega sturdy with a 900-lb weight capacity! I've tested the non-heavy duty version of this chair and found it very comfortable and supportive. At $975 for made-in-USA with a 10-year warranty, I think it's a great value."

Used Zody vs. New Soji?,"Hey, all!

I have an opportunity to pick up a used Haworth Zody for $200 - it‚Äôs about ten years old. From the pictures it looks fine. Are there any issues I should be looking for with regard to used Haworths when I go to see this chair? My other option is a new Soji for around $500! I‚Äôm conflicted, and any help from you have used these chairs before would be greatly appreciated!

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 200 pounds, using for a new work from home gig as well as some gaming."

"Torn on a couple chairs, would appreciate input","Hi all - 

Looking for a new chair to replace my budget run of the mill desk chair.

I WFH and my main hobby in the winter involves computers. So from 8:30AM to about 10:30pm I sit in a chair.

Now obviously I get up, move around, eat and do some other things, but that is a 14 hour window to show my extensive uses.

I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and a small guy. I am torn between the steelcase Gesture, Steelcase Amia, Herman Miller Aeron, and the Herman Miller Embody.

I‚Äôll be blunt about it, I make pretty good money so budget isn‚Äôt a huge issue for me. But I don‚Äôt want to spend it just because I have it. Meaning, I‚Äôd buy the embody at its high price point if it is justifiable, but if the amia is more comfortable, I‚Äôm perfectly okay going down to that end of the spectrum.

I have lumbar scoliosis and honestly not the greatest posture in general when sitting. So a chair that provides lumber support and promotes a natural and comfortable posture is huge for me.

What are your thoughts on the listed chairs and which might fit my body type and usage the best?"
,"The Gesture and Embody are a bit too large for you.

The Amia would be a good fit, but it provides weaker than average lumbar support for an ergonomic office chair.

The Aeron Size A would be a good fit as well, but many users' thighs are sensitive to pressure from the front edge of the seat frame, and it's practically impossible to know whether that would be the case for you.

Some other high-quality ergonomic chairs I've tested which I believe are a better fit given your small frame and desire for decent lumbar support, in no particular order:

* Steelcase Leap V2 (due to its standard tension-adjustable lumbar support)

* Herman Miller Sayl with optional adjustable lumbar support

* 9to5 Seating Cydia Mid-Back with optional adjustable lumbar support, knee-tilt mechanism, and 3D armrests, if you're interested in a frameless all-mesh design. Afaik this combo can't be ordered online, so let me know if you're interested."
,Check out the Haworth fern
,No :)
,They could at least do the digital knit for this price.
,"Eh, not a fan of the color"
,"I am a huge Halo and Fern fan, but I highly prefer my custom Fern with Seafoam Green Digital Knit Back, Canvas seat fabric, and matching black metal frame (which cost many hundreds less, no less), even though I feel like I am the target consumer for this chair...

Still think it is cool that they made it, but they could have done something better than the mesh back considering the amazing stitching design of the Digital Knit Backs they already make for the Fern."
,I paid $500 less for mine months ago. Digital knit without headrest or additional lumbar.
,It's very ugly to say the least. But I guess it has that in common with the Herman Miller Vantum gaming.
,"$1573 on sale? i don't think i would buy it, if i learned something is that the world gaming is a scam, just 200+ dollars/euros more for nothing in particular, where i live in italy (where there are no too good opportunities) i can find an haworth fern new from an AD at 1500‚Ç¨, this seems a little too much, even if in sale"
,"Aaaah, so basically the same treatment as the Embody Logitech: new coat of ""paint"" (in this case just a special color a logo and plastic/rubber trinkets here and there), and an 80% price increase.

And I bet they don't sell it without the headrest, which from what I hear makes the chair horrible (I have a headrest-less Fern and it's great).

God, I hate halo products. In this case, literally and not figuratively..."
,"That is the most cringeworthy thing I've seen. 

Also, how is a chair getting more content than the actual game?"
,Nope
,This chair looks like shit. Literally. Just buy a regular fern for less.
,"If the number 117 was yellow, it could at least look Fallout themed, like a Vault number, lol."
,"Master Chief, you mind telling me what you're doing on that chair?"
,"This is actually really cool design, I have one in blue and it‚Äôs the most beautiful chair I owned!"
,I‚Äôd get another Aeron instead.
,The irony is their new tilt mecahnism and leather for the seatpan would actually fix my gripes with my Fern's seatpan I recently sold.
,Very ugly
,Don't get the gaming version...they can upcharge for some fancy emblems and throw gaming at the end of the name.  I really like the regular mesh model and you're not overpaying for the unnecessary stuff.

Used office chairs rising in price?,"every post I see on here says you can get a used aeon or leap v2 for under 300-400 but the cheapest I've seen now is 600 for either.  I look at posts 2 years ago and lots of these chairs were half the price back then!

&#x200B;

Is it worth to just bite the bullet and drop 600 or do you think the used market will go back down?  Hate to drop like 600 when they were 350-400 not too long ago.  Ik covid messed w prices, but to double the used market in like a year? dam"
,"There are some price gougers out there and they post a lot of ads. Good deals are still out there, they've just been a bit harder to find since the pandemic began."
,Bought a perfectV2 in the Midwest recently for $250.  Heck.. the seller still has some available.
,it's not increasing. it's the same
,I purchased a leapv2 from a guy for 200. I believe it has all features added. Cloth. He said he was selling all the chairs from his business when they went to WFH. Perhaps a real liquidator would charge more. He had Aerons for 450.
,"Given the cost of new chairs have gone up over 30% in a span of roughly 12 months, I think it would be safe to say this in itself will trickle down into the used market. As seen in the car market recently, as the New prices inflate, average consumer cant afford it, therefore the demand for used cars increases, thus pushing the value of used cars up significantly. So kind of like a double whammy.

For example; if a NEW Leap was $998 a year ago, gets used and passed around and you knock say 50% off now its $500. That same process today would be $1299 new, pass it around, now its $650. Maybe even $700-750 since way more people cant afford a new one and are scrambling to find one used. The base cost goes up so it wouldn't make sense for the reselling price to go down.  


One would have to consider the broader inflation as well. All the parts these resellers use to fix up the old used chairs have also gone up. The cost of their time and labor has gone up. Doesn't make sense for the price of their product to go down at a macro level.  


\-Colin at TheBackStore"
,"Every city, etc has a different market. For example my city has few or possibly no mid to large size companies that use Herman Miller so the used market for those chairs effectively doesn't exist here. Every market has those same time of conditions.

Add in that for most of the last two years just about everyone worked from home so there was extremely limited movement in the sales of new chairs to business accounts. These means fewer older chairs entering the used market.

I think we may start to see a market where people sell off some of their WFH gear but as it's going to be individuals I would expect there to be less price flexibility"
Nightingale CXO 6200 new vs old style arm?,"I am looking at some used  Nightingale options and it looks like they updated the arms at some point. Can anyone say when they made the change? Anyone have any preference between the new and old ones?  were there any other changes made to the CXO 6200 that I didn't notice?  Please teach me the way of the Chair, Reddit."
,"From my understanding the chairs arms were updated in 2012. The older style only had two way adjustment and the new ones have four way. 

Other changes made:
-The tilt tension on the older model is a large cylinder knob located underneath the seat. The newer model has a smaller knob located on the side. 

-The headrest on the 6200D on the older model only has height adjustment. The newer model has height and tilt. The built-in coat hook on the newer model is smaller and not as usable IMO.

I highly recommend using a chair mat if on carpet as it is an absolute tank weighing around 85 lbs.

The spring for the depth adjustment of the lumbar does wear out so it may not hold the depth it's set to. Replacement is simple if you are a little handy.

Other than that the two versions are nearly identical. Good luck."
Haworth vs Steelcase vs Herman Miller?,"Hello everybody I'm sure this is a common thread around here, but lately I had the chance to sit in a HM Embody at work for about an hour due to a coworker getting one delivered and letting me try it out. 

For reference, I have a Leap V2 at home and I've also sat in an Aeron and Gesture. I'm 6'4"" and 190lbs so decently skinny but I have good natural seat padding.

Just wanted to share my initial impressions on the ones that I own. I've never had a Haworth and the chair is intriguing to say the least so I'd love some opinions about them if you've tried any.

My Leap V2 is my main chair and one I have had for the longest (~5 years). In short I love it!  The pad is thick and soft so I can sit all day and never get sore, the backrest is also gently padded.  Once you factor in the flexible plastic on the back it is really enjoyable to sit in.  The chair flexes to however you sit on both the back and bottom to accommodate without over bending and reamining supportive. Arms are perfect and adjust well for just about any position. I use them close to my sides for heavy typing and move them all the way out for gaming or lounging. I never worry about leaning on them when I move around.

I recently had the chance to sit in the Embody and I will give a quick impression since I haven't owned it and only got a short time with the chair. Firstly, the padding is THIN.  I can't stress this enough. If you want a thick pad it isn't the chair for you.  HM definitely relies on the little cellular plastic pieces that make up the bottom and back heavily. They do have a unique feel and you can feel them moving under the cushion independently which is a unique way to be supported.  However I don't feel like it's what I want. Instead of feeling like one large flexible seat it ends up feeling like a lot of small platforms with a little support in the center of each platform holding you up. I would not purchase this chair beyond trying to have the most expensive-looking chair in the office. The arms are a step down from the Leap as well. They have fewer adjustment points and the way the chair adjusts the width at an angle is not ideal for me in any way.

The Aeron I also have little experience with but was able to sit in one for a quick try at the store. I love the netting on the chair. I feel that it gives great support and great cushion all in one with great ventilation. I just wish you could execute netting without having such a rigid frame. You're pretty much stuck in the optimal typing position with an Aeron because the seat rises on the sides and the back cups you slightly. Any movement out of the center of the seat means you are leaning on hard plastic so lounging is not something you can do comfortably. That is the extent of my short time on the chair. 

I also tried a Gesture but felt the thinner seat and new arms weren't up to the Leap standards for me. That was 5 years ago when I was shopping for my Leap so I could use a refresher but I remember it being extremely similar but slightly less comfortable for me than the Leap. Still great though."
,"I thought I wanted a Embody, then realized that for me the Fern was a better high back option because it didn't push my shoulder blades forward like the Embody did."
,"Correction, the arms of the Embody do not move forward or backward, but only height and width. They are practically useless for desk work. I had the Embody and at the moment I have the Leap V2, the Gesture, the Aeron Remastered and the Haworth Fern. My favorite is the Fern, then the Aeron, then the Gesture, and finally the Leap"
,Does your leaps back have a warp caused by the tension knob?
,"Aeron Remastered is my pick. It‚Äôs super well built, all thrills no frills. Excellent for larger body types. Mesh holds up incredibly well.

I don‚Äôt sit ‚Äúoptimally‚Äù all day on it. I sit on terrible postures where I slouch so much the backrest is effectively my headrest. It‚Äôs comfy until my body says okay it‚Äôs time to stop doing that.

It‚Äôs also had the least surprises compared to Steelcase and Haworth."
,"I too prefer the leap v2, but the embody is better  for gaming because of the recline mechanism"
,every herman millar chair is bad especially compared to the competition

Search: Ergonomic office chair within Germany - Budget ~500‚Ç¨,"Hi fellow redditors,

I am new to the sub, but already looked through several posts. I am looking for a ergonomic office chair within germany for around 500‚Ç¨ which supports my lower back. I've seen that a lot of ppl recommend the clatina mellet as the best for bucks around 300$ in US, but this one isnt available in germany..just under a other brand called ergotopia which then already costs 429‚Ç¨. 

I've seen that beside the Clatina also a used Steelcase Leap V2 and Amia is recommended as well as a new Haworth Soji(around 560‚Ç¨)?

Currently I have no clue for what I should look for. I use the chair for homeoffice \~9h a day as well as afterwards sometimes for entertainment. I could also slightly increase the budget if neccessary(or better said 'worth it') due to the fact that I will continue working a few days per week in homeoffice and since then I need a good chair to not get more back pain.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions, or did I miss a famous model? Since I am living in germany it's not so easy to get some brands/models unfortunately.

Thanks for the help, appreciated :)"

Help for quality budget chair,"Hey all. I have been a lurker and have scrolled today to find help with this, but also figured I would ask outright :

* budget : around $200
* height : 6'3""
* I do a lot of desk work and need good support

I get that I should eventually get an expensive awesome chair, but right now I need to bridge that gap. So i need something that is decent, helpful for back support and posture. Something that will last a year. What's the best low budget chair just to get by until you can get a really good one?

Thanks in advance. I love you.

Strong Tilt Tension,"Hey Guys,

I recently bought a new office chair from an online retailer and I noticed that the tilt tension on the chair is quite stiff, even when I've loosened it completely. My friend has the same chair as me but he's had it for over 10 years now, and the tilt tension on his chair is very loose on the furthest setting. Is it possible that my new chair just needs to be broken into? Is there a way to loosen the tilt tension on a chair?

Thanks in advance."

Found a New condition Steelcase Leap V2 for $300 ‚Äî not bad.,"Found this from an honest forthright couple on Facebook marketplace. It‚Äôs in brand new condition except for one defect ‚Äî the ‚Äúupper back force‚Äù control is broken (was shipped this way). Steelcase sent the original buyer a new chair and told them to keep the original, thus I ended up getting a deal. Was in the market for a new chair (office max brand just wasn‚Äôt cutting it anymore and the lower back pain was starting to get worse after 4 years working remotely).

Does anyone know if I can fix the ‚Äúupper back force‚Äù thing on my own? Seems like a missing spring or hydraulic or something.

In any case, I feel like this is a massive improvement from my previous chair. Hopefully it lasts for many years to come."

Gesture vs. Fern vs. Aeron,"Hi Everyone,

The company I work for will essentially pay for me to get any high end ergonomic chair under $2,000 for my home office. With that being said, I'm looking primarily at the three chairs I've noted in the title of this post, but I'm open to other suggestions as well if they will better fit my needs.

For some background, I currently have a Steelcase Series 1. I like the chair overall, however my main complaint is that I feel slightly too large for it since my legs extend too far off the sear cushion to be comfortable for long periods of time. For reference, I am 6'3"" tall and about 200 pounds. Most of these chairs I‚Äôm interested in my weight shouldn't be a problem, but my height is where I am most concerned as I don‚Äôt want to end up with another chair that feels as small as the Series 1. In the past, I‚Äôve enjoyed the Aeron as well as the Steelcase Leap chairs that I have used and felt that they both fit me well for longer periods of time.

Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt seem to find any stores nearby with these chairs in stock to try them myself, so I will likely have to buy sight unseen which is also why I‚Äôd like this subreddits advice.

I want to make the most informed decision that I can based on my circumstances, so any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
,"I think the fern is on the small side for me at 6 foot. I find the seat pan is too short, but if I slide it forward it feels like i am hanging off the back."
,"My recommendation is the Aeron size C, I think it will be perfect for your size and weight."
,"The Gesture is the best fit of the three.

Out of the box suggestion - a fully loaded [ergoCentric tCentric Hybrid](https://us-store.ergocentric.com/products/tcentric-hybrid-with-mesh-backrest-and-upholstered-seat-midnight-black). Not quite as premium as the options you listed, but still high-quality and *way* more adjustable. I recommend the ""synchro glide"" mechanism, extra long seat, the most adjustable armrests available, air lumbar support, and the fantastic headrest which can be set completely out of the way when you're not using it."
,"I owned the Gesture and Aeron. I never tried the Fern because the company doesn‚Äôt seem too interested in selling to retail customers. I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the Gesture, but I love my Aeron. Gesture was so bulky and not very comfortable. Aeron is so nice to sit on, looks cool, and very light and easy to move around. I‚Äôd recommend getting an Aeron Remastered size C. I don‚Äôt know any other chairs that come in different sizes and can fit tall people like it does, and I‚Äôve tried a ton"
,I would buy a leap
,"I'm 6'2 and 190 lbs. I know some people find the seat pan on the Fern a bit too small, personally it doesn't bother me but there is some gapping towards the rear.

But imo, it's the only one with a tall enough back which I find the more important portion by far.

Aside from that, I think make sure you're making your pick based on recline mechanism, moveability, breathability, how you sit (ex. Cross legged doesn't work on aeron). I think those are very important to consider"
,"Imo the gesture is a decent agronomic chair with amazing arms, it was a clear ergonomic upgrade over my current crappy chair, but I had to send it back as it gave me sever back pain that would not go away.

Just ordered the embody, which I'm hoping will feel like more of an upgrade as its the seat and back itself that are super innovative on it, instead of just the arms on the gesture."
Herman Miller Sales?,"Hey all,

Do we know if Herman Miller runs a Black Friday sale every year? I am looking to pick up an embody and I could wait a few more weeks if they will have a sale.

I tried calling some authorized dealers to see if better pricing was available after reading some peoples' experiences on here but was quoted MSRP.

If anyone has a dealer they've worked with and had better pricing than MSRP please chime in.

Thank you."
,"Best they do is 15% which will be on Thanksgiving. 
They do also give 10% if you're part of certain group, (ex. Military). Just have to contact a sales person via their website chat."
,"I don't believe they do a ""black friday sale"", but most manufacturers have sales that run a few weeks around the same time.

Google says for 2021 they did a 15% off best sellers for the Holiday Season. I would expect something similar.

,They typically run sales twice a year in the fall and spring. It won‚Äôt be tied to Black Friday.
Herman Miller Vantum Initial Impressions,"Hey just got my vantum and wanted to give my 2 cents on initial impressions. Keep in mind I've only had the chair for a day. Thoughts:

1. It looked like a taller Sayl to me, but the cushion is not the same as the Sayl. Thank goodness for this. It is a cushion that is loftier and more puffier, but much much more firmer. The cushion is VERY stiff, but I assume this will soften over time.

2. The fabric on the seat and backrest seem similar and it is very scritchy. As in the fabric is similar to Steelcase's Gesture/Leap. It is a rough fabric, but it feels like there is a bit of ventilation.

3. Armrests are good enough. It is not angled like the Aeron, but it is much much much better than the Embody. You can move it up right left down, but not at an angle. Goes up and down, the arm pillars do not move.

4. Tall people beware. I am 6 ft and unfortunately they went with the same concept as the Aeron and used a frame all around the back that is plastic just like the Aeron. It will dig into your shoulder blades over time if you do not use the headrest. As of now, I can already feel it digging into my shoulder blades when I lean back. HOWEVER. If you sit upright, you won't feel it at all as the chair does not sink your back in. It is a flat wall, so your shoulder blades won't be in contact with the plastic frame if you sit upright.

5.  The headrest is actually good. I had doubts, but it brings the chair to life and really makes it a unique experience. I wanted to try this chair as a lounging and leaning back chair and it fits the bill.

6. Another quick update: Leaning back and then coming back up, the chair wobbles along with the headrest. Truly makes the chair feel cheap.

7. Another another update: This chair does not have the tilt forward mechanism found on the Aeron AND the headrest is a downgrade for me now because you have to use a lot of power to change the height of the headrest. This is pretty annoying and I will imagine someone with not a lot of strength will have great difficulty. I don't know why they made the height adjuster SO tough to move around.

8. Next update: When leaning back, the armrests positions' do not follow with the chair. Meaning that when you lean back and want to place your elbows on the armrests, you can't. The armrests are way too forward so you can only place your forearm on it and not your elbow. Huge design flaw I'm seeing here, almost every chair in the world has this. This is no longer a lounge chair since they did not give 2 chickens about the chair ergonomics when it leans back.


Overall, the chair for 1k is much better of a deal than the Sayl. You pretty much get an all-around good chair that's jack of all trades. It's not the best, but it's good enough and the fact that it has a headrest makes it even more versatile. In my opinion, this chair will sell very well as Herman Miller did an excellent job with the ergonomics and design.

P.S - The chair feels like an HM premium only because of the fabric, but once you take that out of the equation, the chair feels like an Ikea $5 chair. The frame overall feels very cheap. I can tell HM cut costs on this chair a lot.

P.P.S - This chair comes UNASSEMBLED. There are 3 parts. The headrest, the seat/back unit, and the wheel unit. It is EXTREMELY SMOOTH BRAIN EASY TO ASSEMBLE THIS CHAIR. You need to have an IQ of -1 to be confused about it. You literally just pop slide the seat/back unit into the wheel unit and slide the headrest into place. That's it. I was afraid that it would be a pain, but I'm kind of confused why HM bothered to even make this chair unassembled since assembly was THAT easy.

Ask your super detailed questions. I'm tired of waiting for generic youtube reviews so I'll give you all super detailed answers as best I can.

I will update this post with timestamps the more I use it and note any changes.

Next day update: Those who are looking for super strong lumbar support won't find it here. The problem is that while it can give strong lumbar support, the 2 plastic circles can overlap and dig into your skin. I can feel it very prominently when I lead back against the lumbar. It starts to really hurt as if my skin is being dug into by a spoon or ladle.

I am afraid this chair is nothing new or innovative. It is a generic Ikea chair that just got a cool design and some fancy fabric. The foam feels very cheap and it is very hot. My butt sweats in it. So while it will sell due to gaming marketing and GAMER aesthetic, those who are looking for a true quality chair won't find it here. Stick to the Gesture or Aeron."
,"Yikes, the hardest of passes for me. I honestly can‚Äôt fathom a single reason to purchase this chair over it‚Äôs competition aside from the addition of the poorly executed headrest."
,So basically exactly what everyone assumed.
,"Thanks a bunch for the review, friend!  Always nice to see some effort being put forth from someone who has nothing to gain from the review. 

I also like that this has nothing on the Leap which also makes me happy since that's what I own."
,"This confirms my thought that its an ok tier chair but reaaaally not adapted to the ""gaming"" market x)

The chair sounds like a pretty middle of the road HM but the price is just ... 500 D for the most expensive ""gaming chair"" and then you compete with a 1200 D okay-ish chair ?

I hope HM and other brands like Steelcase can figure out best how to enter the gaming market because i hardly doubt that this will make a hit"
,"I got mine yesterday and it really does not feel like a $1000 chair, but I did sleep through the entire night without waking up from neck pain for the first time in years. Does the Steelcase Gesture feel dramatically more comfortable (and are the armrests less terrible), or just more solidly built?"

,"From my understanding, anyone selling Herman Miller Brand products on Amazon are not authorized to do so and would not recommend buying from any of them. Those who are still out there simply haven't gotten caught yet.

Herman Miller does not allow their retail partners to sell on Amazon. They dont want their Brand to be tarnished by Amazons ""race to the bottom"" because Amazon doesn't adhere to Minimum Advertised Pricing standards that manufacturers put in place.

Every time we do a sweep of HM products its always some new different online seller trying to dropship products from some other 3rd party website, often sourcing decade old products from liquidators with no warranty and trying to pass them as new directly from HM.

This is a big no-no on Amazon and literally thousands of sellers attempting to do this sort of business are banned every single day. Buying from any of them would be supporting unethical business practices at best, and victim of flat out illegal deception and fraud at worst."

I tried out the Fern and Soji in store too, and the Soji felt great but didn‚Äôt go low enough to rest my feet flat on the ground. The Fern did and felt fantastic, but was out of my budget. 

FWIW, I have been able to use both an Aeron and a Knoll Generation for extended periods previously. The mesh on the Aeron was uncomfortable and the chair was too big.

,"Some office chairs sit low, others sit high, and the rest in between. It's important to know which seat height range you need. 

Your resting elbow height should just about match the height of your desk surface while you sit back in your chair. This allows your shoulders to relax while typing/mousing, and limits or prevents nerve compression caused by over-reliance on armrests or the desk surface for arm support. Thus, whether you plant your feet on the floor or on a footrest depends on your keyboard & mouse surface height."
,"For my shorter customers, I recommend them trying a Herman Miller Sayl and a Steelcase Series 1 first.  But most of the good ones like a Haworth Fern, Steelcase Leap or Amia or Herman Miller Mirra have some sort of seat slider or adjustment to make it smaller.  I don't normally recommend Aerons cause I get such low customer satisfaction on them."

,Get good seat where you can get your knees to 90 degrees - feet flat at ground. Then measure distance from floor to kneecap. That is the height you want to minimally have when choosing chair. Most of them show lowest point in inch / cm and it's easier to find out what would be good for you :)

Change my mind: Nightingale CXO is the best office chair.,"Even if you can't use the head rest or arm rests they're both removable.

Edit: I've spent $15k-$20k on chairs over the past 2 years so ask me anything."

But there is no best office chair to rule them all, rather there is only the best office chair that fits your unique body, needs, and budget."
,"Glad you finally found your one true chair! I've found chairs, like shoes, earbuds, etc., are uniquely personal. For example, lots of people swear by the Leap v2, but it's borderline unusable for you and I. How does the headrest on the CXO work? Does it have any depth adjustment like on the Humanscale Freedom?"
,"How do you compare it to the Leap v2? I tried the Leap V2 today and like it but I'm 6'4 and have a hard time finding a good headrest for it (The Aeron headrest hack looks like it pushes your head to far forward which I want to avoid because I get upper shoulder pain sometimes).

Is the seat better on the CXO? Are the arm pads soft and squishy like the Leap? Do you feel the plastic on top by the shoulders on the CXO or does the head rest help with that? Unfortunately I can't find anywhere to try the CXO.

Do you have experience buying refurbished chairs? They seem pretty hit or miss.

Also I'm used to plush chairs and was looking at the Neutral Posture BTC chair have you tried it?"
,"why is this better than, say, a Steelcase Leap v2"
,"I was really impressed by its design and quality but the backrest was too short for me at 6 feet such that the plastic lip would bug my shoulders. I also found the headrest didn‚Äôt adjust anywhere good for me. Armrests could be softer too (hard plastic). 

Glad it works for you though üëç"
,"I'm glad it works for you. I got mine, can't even sit for an hour and my ass is numb. I'll give it that it beats the Aeron, Gesture and Leap for me, but it still isn't something I can use. I still prefer my Serta Office Chair I got off amazon that is like a third the price. It's probably my fault being a bigger person (6' 1, 300+ lbs, although I am down near 30 pounds since August, so I'm getting better). I could see the chair working out for someone that is smaller (both in weight and just general size), but it just doesn't work out for me."
,What is your build and height? That is an important consideration people leave out when saying what the best chair is. I feel there are best chairs for different heights and weights

"6'4, 215lbs - Canada Recommendations - I Hate ""Gaming Chairs"" Edition","Hey Everyone, 

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to read this request. Second, I need some help. 

I am currently sitting on some POS Noblechairs ""Gaming Chair"". It is complete with both ""4D"" armrests and even came with a pillow.

Fast forward one year, and my back feels like I got bucked off a horse. Additionally,  I despise this thing with every ounce of my being. The seat disintegrated, the armrests might as well be made out of concrete, it's very ugly, etc. etc.

I'm looking for something under the 750ish CAD range, but would really like to be around 500 CAD if I can. That being said, being that I'm tall / all torso (yes, like a dachshund), a tall back and a headrest are preferable. I have checked to see if there's any local liquidators or used sellers / wholesalers in my area (If there was a used Steelcase or HM around I would have bought it).  Shipping to Canada seems tenuous at best. I'm not really local to anywhere that I can go sit on a bunch either, so I'm kind of at your mercy. 

TLDR please help me. If I waste another 250+ on a staples chair or see another gaming chair in my life I'm going to puke."

I assume your keyboard and mouse a standard ~29""-high desk. This is much too high for a 5'7"" user to sit in healthy posture. Consider adjusting your seat higher and placing your feet on a footrest, so you can type/mouse while sitting with your shoulders relaxed and your back fully against the backrest, and your head square above your shoulders (to minimize neck strain).

Recliner 'Suspension' seat - Coccyx pain help!,"Greetings,

&#x200B;

I've spent hours over  7 years searching. I've bought and tried dozens of chairs.  I can't seem to find anything that will work (office focused, see below). I have chronic Coccyx pain, and struggle with, at times, more than an hours session without pain. I've recently come to purchase a cheap recliner chair, I'll link it below - and have found that my pain is completely alleviated.  The problem is, this chair is not an office chair. Its not on wheels, it does not put me in a great forward upright position, its so very low, and its kind of a piece of junk if I'm honest.

What I've come to conclude is the miracle fix is the fact that my tailbone is completely suspended when in this chair. When flipping and looking at the bottom of the seat, its a suspension style. There is NO seat pan.  Its a similar design to the seat of a lazyboy recliner, etc. If you look at a recliner chair's seat, its often a cushion, that's over a thin wire suspension and will have a elastic band below to tie it all together and prevent sagging.

This is what I'm trying to find, but in an  office chair. Something that lets my ass hang and keep me out of pain!

I sat in an Aeron at a show room, but am not sure its for me. I still had pain, and I don't think I like the frame layout. I've tried other mesh chairs, but think they are too 'firm' because there's no cushion to, well cushion, before my rump sags.

Here is an amazon link to the chair I got that 'works', hopefully this helps articulate what I'm looking for.  Sorry for the wall of text, I felt the more the better.  


If anyone with similar struggles has any ideas, or if a savant out there understands my ramblings and thinks they know a chair that may help, I'd so greatly appreciate the help, I'm tired of being in pain!

,"Office chair manufacturers that specialize in custom builds offer seats with a built-in coccyx cutout. I believe this is exactly what you're looking for. 

Off the top of my head, some brands that offer chairs with coccyx cutouts include Sitmatic, BodyBilt, Office Master, Neutral Posture, RFM Seating, ergoCentric, and maybe VIA Seating and Seating Inc. For most of these companies you'll have to work with a dealer to get a chair with a coccyx cutout seat, but you can order some online (lmk if you prefer this method of ordering and need help finding online vendors).

Office Master is the only vendor I've seen that offers a ""concealed"" coccyx cutout made to look like a regular seat.

Torn between Amia and Leap v2 from Crandall,"Which one do you prefer and why?

Any benefits of one over the other for tallish people 6'0ish and 205 pounds?

I purchased the Amia but seeing all these reviews on how plush their leap V2 looks, I hope I made the right choice."
,"The BTOD guys all agreed in their chair tier ranking video that the Amia has the more comfortable seat, but the Leap V2 back offers more back adjustments."
,"I'm 6'2 180 and love the amia, it doesn't lean back too far but it's by far the best chair ive had. Never tried a leap however."
,"I‚Äôve used a Leap V2 for a while and recently picked up an Amia. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù 180lbs.

To me they feel almost identical, but I much prefer the Leap because of the adjustments to the back. You can tighten the lean way more (although this may be due to my Amia being used) and you can also set different stop points for the lean. I think those features are super nice to have because I lean back in my chair ALOT.

Also, I think you can get an official headrest for the leap, but if you want to add one to the Amia you gotta drill holes.

Either way, the Amia is a fantastic chair with plenty of adjustability, and unless those specific features matter to you, you‚Äôll love it."
,"The two chairs are very similar...in fact most of my customers get confused between them they are so similar.  The Leap does a few extra things the Amia doesn't...mainly the adjustable lumbar and the tilt lock 25% intervals.  But they feel pretty close.  For the same price I think it makes sense to go with the leap but if the Leap is more $$ they are a pretty good trade off for price/features.  What I would recommend over both of them is the Haworth Fern tho.  I used a Leap for 10 years and loved it but when I tried the Fern I realize it was very similar to the Leap but better in nearly every way.  The high back especially is a plus for taller people:)  In the end, it's hard to go wrong with any of the 3 chairs but I'd rank them Fern, Leap and then Amia with a very little difference between the Leap and Amia and a slightly bigger jump up to the Fern.  Hope this helps!"
,"I bought the Leap v2 from Crandall and the Amia from steelcase directly. The Leap had a much better back but the tailbone pain was excruciating. The Amia seat was great, but the back was fine. I decided my best chance to get the best of both worlds was the Crandall remanufactured Leap v2, which includes a thicker pad that's supposedly comparable to the Amia. Still waiting on that to go on a black friday sale, but when it does, I'll buy that"

Replacing caster bushings on a chair?,"Hey guys, hoping you might be able to help. I have some specific requirements for chairs that are really hard to meet. I found a chair that did the trick within my price range, the [Staples Whitcomb](https://www.amazon.com/Staples-Whitcomb-Fabric-Tall-Chair/dp/B07YJH2MK9/).

It's been a great chair even if the padding in the seat has already worn down. The only problem I'm running into now is the plastic bushings in the legs of the base have worn out and the casters are no longer staying connected to the chair. If I move it, one or two pop out and I have to put them back in.

Do you know of any way I can extract those bushings and replace them? Also, where to find plastic bushings that would work?

Failing that, I could use recommendations on a new chair. It needs to have a minimum 24"" seat width, fabric (I live in a hot climate), can hold 400+ lbs, high back, and full recline. I'd prefer to spend less than $400, if possible.

Thanks in advance!"
Buying a second-hand chair,"What do I need to check before buying a second-hand chair (HM, Steelcase, Humanscale, Haworth...) ? 

And is it best to buy one of those high-end models used or a new one from mid-range ?"
,"The higher end brands for the most part include a 12 year warranty with a new chair purchase. It isn't so much that every chair is going to break in that time and need service but rather a way that those manufacturers are putting in writing a claim to corporate buyers that these chairs will last at least that long. Those warranty costs though end up being built in the chair cost.

Also when someone is buying 100+ of these chairs at once there is definitely a bulk discount. Further, a lot of these large orders get handled by local dealers that have their own margins.

That is important to understand as these pieces are all part of the price of the new chair and buying a used one can save you all those pieces. Also based on your local market, etc the local dealers could have sample chairs they are looking to sell for well under MSRP, etc.

It really depends on your personal preference to if a chair needs to be new or if you are willing to consider a second hard chair."

Has anyone ever found that cheaper chairs can be as comfortable as the brand name chairs?,Or will expensive chairs be always much better than cheaper generic brands?
,"It's pretty important to distinguish between ""comfortable"" and ""ergonomic"". It doesn't take much effort to make a chair that anyone would be fine in for a few hours.

For example, I have a friend who after simply misusing their armrests now requires painkillers to have any kind of relief from the aches in his arms he wouldn't have sat like that if it wasn't ""comfortable"" of course but ""comfort"" doesn't mean ""healthy"".

High end manufacturers consider these long term conditions that are hardly noticeable until too late and design chairs that mitigate them and promote ways of sitting that are not just comfortable during your sit.

Sorry if this is a long reply, and don't get me wrong if a chair works I'm no snob. But when it comes to a chair that you may spend a decade or so using the reputation of a brand for research and attention to detail is important."
,"Honestly? Yeah, but only to a certain extent.

At work I have a shitty, nameless chair with no flexibility and terrible armrests... and it's cushion is more comfortable than my Amia. But in terms of ergonomics and lean-back? Amia is far better.

The little things are by far the best parts of my chair investment. Other things can be comfortable, but only until they're not."
,"For most people, there are plenty of cheaper chairs that will feel comfortable enough. But cheaper chairs generally degrade more quickly than higher-end chairs. It helps to know which chairs are particularly well-built for their price points."
,Yeah but not for any longer than watching a movie or shorter sit time.
,"Personally I feel like the mid range brands are actually more comfortable on average than the high end ones. They typically have thicker seat cushions which makes a big difference. I tried out a few humanscale chairs before but the 2"" cushions did not do the job at all for me and I am only a medium weight guy. Most high end chairs don't go much thicker than that, save for Nightingale and Neutral Posture.

I personally need about a 3"" thick cushion for a chair I am going to be sitting in all day."
,"Something to keep in mind is **every** single chair, from the cheapest to thee most expensive takes a range of their ""ideal user size"" and builds a chair around that. This means if you are either very petite, tall or large you are much more likely to fall outside of the ""ideal"" range for a lot of chairs. 

Now if your body size is extremely ""average"" you could have a lot higher change of finding a ""cheaper"" chair that will work well for you. That is where the higher end brand name ergonomic chairs really start to shine. These chairs have more ways they can be adjusted to suit the individual. The biggest two often absent on cheaper chairs are adjustable seat depth and adjustable lumbar support.   


The higher end ergonomic chairs often end up in corporate settings where they are treated as a physical asset. This means they are assigned a useful life (often the 12 year warranty period). Once that useful life, on the financial statement, is used up the chairs are sold or otherwise disposed. So there can often be a very functional chair, often if good or better condition, that on a financial statement has a value of $0 even though it has mean years of functional life left. That is why these chairs can often be had for a heavy discount on the secondary (used) market.

My suggestion would be to look at the generic (ie not chair specific) guides on proper ergonomics for an office chair. With that information you can start make informed choices if any chair is going to be right for you as an individual."
(AUS) Bought a Steelcase Gesture a week ago....,"Hey all! Very recently bought a steelcase gesture during a 30% off sale (arms, no headrest). Brand new. Owned for a about 5 days.

I haven't found it as comfortable as I'd hoped.

Contacted steelcase and was advised 25% restocking fee, lost my delivery fee (that's fine), I have to deliver it myself to their warehouse. I dont think I could stomach a $400 loss for that.

Other than eBay, what options do I have to sell it?"
,"Any chance the large city nearest you as a Steelcase dealer? They can be more flexible on returns etc

Also keep in mind all ergonmic chairs aren't going to be magic. The user needs a basic level of knowledge in how to adjust the chair to match their body. Also on general knees to ankles and below the shoulder on the arm aren't issues a chair can directly fix. 

My strong advice would be get someone to get some good pictures of you sitting in the chair including side shots of just you and the chair and you, the chair and your work area. Also note specifically where the chair is hurting you if it is. That's all information you will need to help select the next chair."
,Where are you located?
,"You could try Facebook marketplace but you‚Äôre also going to be sitting on it for a while unless you price the chair well below msrp that it would make sense for someone who wants to buy without warranty because the warranty is half the price of the chair. 

I would recommend that you sit in the chair more before deciding whether to sell it or not. What is not working for you? Is it not comfy? Is it causing pain? Because you have to use the chair for longer than 5 days to really get accustomed to the chair. 

Where did you buy from that gave you 30% off the chair?"
Major back pain from Branch Verve?,"Hey all, I was excited to get my first-ever ergo chair and went with the Branch Verve. I would have gone with one of the regular top ergo choices but this seemed like a solid combination of function and fashion (small apartment living!).

[https://www.branchfurniture.com/products/verve-chair](https://www.branchfurniture.com/products/verve-chair)

Totally fine and comfortable first couple days, and then woke up with my back feeling totally wrecked, with pain throughout - lower, upper, even neck somewhat. No prior history of back pain.

Even after taking a day off from the chair, I try to sit and within 30mins I can feel the discomfort and pain creeping in again, starting from the lower back. My spine seems to really not like the (non-removable) lumbar support (and I've tried adjusting height on that).

Anyone have experiences with this chair or other Branch chairs, positive or negative? Or any general tips about this? I'm about a week in - do I need to give it more time or should I just return?

Thanks!"

Recommendations for tall person (not Aeron or Leap)?,"Hey all,

I've been searching for a good office chair for a little while. I'm 6'2 175 lbs (active + stretch a lot), and first tried the **Leap v2** direct from Steelcase. I thought it was an upgrade from my previous chair, but definitely not perfect for a $1400 chair.

I then got an **Aeron size B** from Crandall (condition was fine but not great), and I'm not a fan**.** The lumbar support is poor and I don't like the plastic edge digging into me at the top of the backrest.

Can you share a little of experience on what you both liked and disliked on the chair? With the details you included on the Aeron it could really help with further suggestions."
,"It's hit or miss whether your shoulders would contact the top of the Zody's backrest frame, and that's assuming your torso isn't particularly long for your height.

Christmas Gift for husband.,"Hi all! I was looking to buy either a Gesture or a Leap for my husband's Christmas gift this year (both with headrests). I've read the headrest on the Gesture is better, along with the arms, but that the Leap's seat is better. 

He is in the chair for about 3 hours a day, except on weekends where he's in it for much longer to play games. He's about 5'7"", 190 lbs, complains of lower back aches because of work. He also likes to cross his leg in his seat every now and again. In the chair he's currently using, he seems to like to slouch a bit in it and he does use it to nap every once in a blue moon. I guess he isn't the most ""ergonomic sitter"" but would one of these chairs be better for him based off of my weak description? I was leaning to the Leap at first because of the seat, but I'm concerned about the headrest."
,Gesture above leap for sure
,"My wife and I find the seat of my Gesture much more comfortable than that of her Leap. Also, the Gesture headrest is a thousand times better."
,"I am 6'4"" and have a Leap V2 with the headrest. I live the chair. I hate the headrest - always seems to be in just the wrong, annoying positron for me."
,Get a Amia over them two. Cheaper and a more comfortable seat. Also doesn‚Äôt force you to sit as ergonomically so he can cross his legs. Definitely sounds like the right choice for this scenario. Save a few bucks along the way.

Looking for something very comfortable to replace a chair that is falling apart,"I currently own [this chair](https://static.staples.pt/resources/medias/shop/products/thumbnails/shop-image-2000/shop-353511--1.jpg) that I absolutely love, its by far the most comfortable chair I've ever used, I really like the fluffiness of it, when I bought it, it felt like sitting on a cloud.

I often (basically every day) end up taking a nap while in front of my PC and I've actually slept through the night on it several times over the last 4 years.

Unfortunately the leather quality isn't the best (started coming apart like a year and a half after I bought it) and even the padding itself has lost quite a bit of height over time to the point I feel it needs to be replaced.


I usually spend around 14 to 16 hours a day in front of the computer and like to sit in different positions, sometimes sitting straight, crossing my legs on top of the chair or other times almost laying down, looking at most recommendations on the sub the chairs all seem very stiff and force you to be in a certain position.


I've tried mesh chairs and I really don't like them. I am looking for something very comfortable and with a good area to rest my head.

Either good quality leather that won't start flaking after a short while or fabric.


Right now from what I saw so far my options are just buying the same chair again (it costs 250 euros) over and over when it starts going bad or a secretlab fabric.


My max budget would be around 1000 euros + tax.

Is there a gas lift without the lifting mechanism?,"Hi,

I'm using my chair with highest setting all the time since I'm 6""4 (193cm) and 275lbs (125kg) and most gas lifts don't hold up after a few months of use. Since I don't need to adjust the height and basically use the highest setting I was wondering if there's basically a metal thingy that I can replace my chair's gas lift so I won't have to worry about the gas lift not holding up after a while.

Lower-back weary since using ergonomic chair (steelcase leap v2),"Hi!

So I just bought a 2nd Steelcase leap chair v2 and this is my first ergonomic chair.

Before this, I always use super cheap office chairs (like $25) and sit with my back bent a bit (arching? slouching?). When walking or standing, my back curves a bit and if I remember, I will push a bit of my chest forward so my posture is straight, but this doesn't come naturally. But I have 0 problem, no backpain what so ever. Probably light [Kyphosis?](https://onzspine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/spinal-deformity-types-840x600.jpg)

Now its been a week, I follow all the best practices and put the lumbar right at my lower back. But after 2-3 hours I feel a bit weary in my lower back region and need to stretch and bend to relieve.

I'm not an English native speaker so I'm sorry if this confuses you. But the feeling is a bit the same as trying actively stand straight (like a soldier). After a while, I feel the need to bend to release the weary feeling.

Does this mean the chair is working (forcing me to be straight) or something is wrong?

If this is supposed to happen, then how long will it take for me to no longer feel the weary?

Thanks!"
,"The leap was my first ergo chair as well. I also had pain for about a month and was considering returning it. Now the pain is gone and my sitting posture in general has improved. I think the aggressive shape of the chair really enforces a better posture. When I sit in worse chairs now I wish I was in my leap lol. Removing the adjustable lumbar also helped me ease into the chair, there are videos out there on how and it is really simple."

Are gaming chairs any good when it comes to ergonomics?,"I got this idea that they could be great because gamers game for hours. Then I looked into it a little and at least GamersNexus says they are garbage and should be avoided. I am a programmer so I do clock a lot of hours in front of a computer and of course have some back and shoulder pain from time to time, so that's what got me thinking could gaming chairs be an improvement over standard office chairs. Any experiences to share?"
,"I had a couple of  gaming chairs going into the pandemic work from home environment. At first the cushioning really helped, but I started noticing my back was sore and I had to get up a few times to readjust my posture. I have days when I am sitting for 6-8 hours straight in meetings or designing software/ processes, so it's a lot of sitting in front of screens.

It started getting worse as the year went on but I stuck it out blaming the mattress or what not. Finally, when I went back to the office in mid 2021, I noticed the days I went to the office the back pain was practically gone- because the office had Herman Miller Verus chairs.

I decided to buy an office chair and fortunately got a used Aeron chair for cheap. It has been a game changer! No more back pain even after extended sitting sessions. I've since gotten a standing desk and walk around every couple of hours.

TLDR: Idk about standard office chairs, but good office chairs will beat a gaming chair any day of the week hands down."

I sat in it for a week and it was uncomfortable at first, at week 2 my asshole hurt. Yes. My asshole. At week 3 I gave up and asked for an RMA - my back, my crack and my sack were unhappy. Went back to the old best up Ikea chair which I've used for the pandemic.. it's not great and my back and shoulder were killing me.

I'm 6'2"" 220lbs and have a longer torso or neck - legs are similar to my 5'6"" wife. The chair isnt perfect but the pain relief was fairly quick. I'm sure a different ergonomic chair would work but it's nice having something that works at all."
Looking for a new office chair,"I've struggled with trying to find the right office chair for years now. It seems like I go through them every couple of years.

While I liked it in the beginning, it's very uncomfortable and actually too big now after I lost weight.

I'm looking for just a simple office chair that has some ergonomics, like adjustable lumbar support, adjustable arm rests, and if can be in my budget - adjustable seat. Something that will last for a few years and has good reviews.

I'm 6ft and weight 300 pounds. My budget for a new chair is $400. If anyone has any recommendations, I would appreciate it!"
,"Congrats on losing weight! Most decent chairs at under $400 have a weight capacity of 300 lbs, so keep up the effort! The HON Ignition 2.0 is one such chair that I recommend due to its comfort, overall adjustability, and its width-adjustable whole armrests (not just the caps); it is one of the creakier chairs I've tested, however.

If you're particularly confident that you'll continue to lose weight, this 300-lb capacity [Bowery Hill chair](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bowery-Hill-22-5-Modern-Metal-and-Fabric-Mesh-High-Back-Task-Chair-in-Black/439217586) is fantastic for the price, but only the armrest caps are adjustable. As you are now, it would be a bit of a tight fit, but you could still use it.

If you prefer to play it safe with a higher-capacity chair, I strongly recommend increasing your budget to around $500 because there's nothing very good at $400 or less. Some good 400-lb capacity options, in no particular order:

1. Remanufactured Steelcase Leap V1 Highback (with optional heavy duty casters) from Crandall Office, if you're confident you won't exceed ~330 lbs because only the armrests caps are adjustable.

2. [Sitmatic Goodfit Mid-Back](https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/9411323/Sitmatic-GoodFit-Mid-Back-Chair-With/). Trust me on the mid-back, it's taller than it seems and very height-adjustable; the high-back is for ~6'3""+ users.

3. HON Wave Mesh Big and Tall Executive Chair. The armrests are underwhelming (too far forward and likely to flake or even crack over time) but the rest of the chair is quite good."
Got my Humanscale Liberty!! but Help!,"As the title says I got a Humanscale Liberty in excellent condition for about 200 bucks. 

While I love the chair I wish it tilted back with a little more pressure. Sometimes I just want to rest back a little but cannot do it without having to hold myself up and it bugs me a little. Is there any way I can configure tilt hardness?"
,"There should be an adjustment screw under the seat.

,Not on a Humanscale chair. Did you not try out the chair first? The Humanscale chair uses you own body weight to help lean back so everyone‚Äôs level of hardness to lean back is going to be different. I love the way they look but I know I would like it simply because of this to be honest.
What parts are these?,"For context, a friend of mine bought this chair from amazon but its missing a few parts. I got no clue what these parts are and I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs any way of obtaining these parts."
,"Not easy to know without knowing the chair. Based on the look of the drawing though it's a somewhat generic chair, and I suspect the N-piece is relatively easy to replace. I would take the headrest it connects with to a hardware store, and test screws to see if any fit. With any luck it's a common size.

The J piece looks more structural and is likely not as easy of a replacement. 

My first recommendation would be to reach out to the seller and request replacements for the missing parts."
,Tell him to contact the seller or get a refund.
"Looking for a chair with aeron level back support but a softer, better seat?","I bought an aeron recently and love the back support, especially how smoothly it reclines (lots of recline angles, can smoothly follow my movement from leaning back to sitting straight all in one swoop)

But the seat is just, so uncomfortable. Hard, puts pressure in my tail bone. And I love to sit criss cross apple sauce on chairs every now or then, or in different positions, and the aeron just doesn't have enough space for anything but feet flat on the ground.

I'm **5' 2"" 120 lbs**, am considering a fern but don't want to make such a big jump when there's no Haworth stores for me to try the chair out in. Also scared about dealing with refund policies etc.

Looking for recommendations, as well as any cheap chairs that would work well as a temporary fix for the next few months before I find something good"

Amia vs Leap v2 for short person with knee pain,"Hi all! I have gone through so many office chairs in the WFH covid era (Since March of 2020-- approximately 4 so far). I am looking and liking the Steelcase offerings. I am looking at Crandall Office for a re manufactured or return-- not sure which yet. 

First question-- anyone bought from them? What was your experience? 

Second question-- Amia vs Leap v2? I am short-- 5'1 with knee pain. I definitely need a chair that will not cut off circulation to my legs/knees. 

Thanks for any thoughts!"
,Amia. But note that the Amia has weaker lumbar support than the Leap.
Overwhelmed by options,"Hi everyone,

In the market for a new chair and have spent a good number of hours reading and watching reviews that cover the whole gamut from $250 - $1,500+ and I‚Äôm just not sure where to turn for the best option out there. Hoping you guys can help!

Current chair: Amazon budget full mesh chair that I‚Äôve had since 2020. No longer being sold so I can‚Äôt link it. The mesh fell apart fairly quickly and the seat is currently causing pressure points where the tension has given way and the seat is resting on the plastic base. 

Budget: $500-$700 is a comfortable area but if it means not having to buy a chair again for another 10 years, I‚Äôm good with a little more

Use: Graphic Designer sitting/standing at a desk for 9-12 hours a day, generally 3-4 hours at a time.

Build: 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 205-215lbs

Body Issues: Back and hip problems so anything to help with those would be great. 

Materials: Ideally mesh or at least a lightweight breathable material. I run very hot and have noticed in the past that fabric chairs tend to absorb a lot more odor. 

Lumbar: I‚Äôm more of a soft/medium lumbar support person as opposed to constant hard pressure. 

Colors: Black, grey, charcoal, light grey are all good. Not opposed to a colored fabric in the blues

New or Refurb is fine.

List that I am currently researching:

- Haworth Fern
- Steelcase Gesture Refurb
- Admiral by Realm of Thrones
- Herman Miller Aeron Refurb
- Steelcase Leap V2
- Sidio T80
- SecretLab Neue
- Clatina Millet

Thank you so much for any recommendations!"
,"The Steelcase Amia Air is a high-quality mesh-back chair with a very comfy seat and medium-soft lumbar support. Crandall has a few like-new units in stock for around $600, and they're warranted for 12 years! https://www.crandalloffice.com/?s=Amia+air&post_type=product"
,"The [9to5 Seating Cydia](https://officechairsoutlet.com/collections/9-to-5/products/cydia-mesh-conference-mesh-high-back-chair-3310?variant=42892917309683)  is so close to exactly what you're looking for - a well-built, comfortable, breathable gray mesh chair with a frameless seat and medium-soft lumbar support that's a good fit for your frame. The one imperfection is that the mesh is warranted for only 5 years, not 10+."
,"I have a Clatina Millet, i'm 5'6"" 220lbs. I took the lumbar support out on recommendation of this sub, certainly makes the back more comfortable. The chair is way more comfortable than the Flash Furniture mesh chair our office got us on the chair ""refresh"" cycle. I do wish the arms were about an inch taller but I can add some pads to them for that. The seat is firm in a supportive way, i no longer HAVE to get up every hour like i did in the old chair. I do wish the seat was just a tad wider though. With this being as comfortable as it is, makes me think what a real Leap would be like..."
,"Don't forget to checkout Eurotech's lineup: [https://www.eurotechseating.com/task](https://www.eurotechseating.com/task)

Don't get the SecretLab and I would probably pass on the Admiral, the SIDIZ T80, and the Clatina Millet. Most of the others you listed are good, but diminishing returns the more money you spend."
,Your best bet will probably be the steelcase leapv2.
,My recommendation is to go to a dealer or surplus office furniture store in your area and check out chairs.
,"I am in favour of the fern, but every person is different. Try to get the chairs to try them out for a few days"
How does the Haworth Fern lumbar support compare to the Leap V2?,"I used a Leap V2 for many years at work and liked it a lot. However, I always had the lumbar support in the highest position and sometimes found it a little intrusive, but not enough to be a deal-breaker.

My new company gets me access to the Haworth Corporate Program so I'm able to get a sweet deal on a Fern, but I'm torn on whether I'll need the additional lumbar support. I'm not really in a location where I can go try the out, so I was hoping I could solicit opinions from someone who has tried both.

Thoughts?"
,"The fern is basically upgraded from the Leap in almost every way.  I like both of them, but the Fern is my favorite chair on the market."
,"If you don't need much lumbar support, then without it. But if you are like me and need a lot of assistance for your lower back, then you do need it. Also, In my experience, the Fern feels much better than the Leap V2. I have both"
,"Fern has a much more pronounced lumbar support, but the Leap V2 has an easier to lean and support backrest feature.

Fern is also a much taller backrest."
,"Take the additional lumbar support, if it is too strong you can put it to the lowest height and it will have no effect."
,"Out of curiosity, how much less is it to get a fern from the corporate program? I‚Äôm going to be testing out a few this week at a local dealer and I‚Äôll be able to grab one at GSA pricing from there, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine they get much cheaper than on modern planet, right? You can do a fully custom with every option, not leather, haven‚Äôt priced that.. but basically everything else for around $1400. Odds of the GSA or corporate pricing being under $1000?"
Hate it when I see a post for a top tier chair for $50 bucks but it turns out I'm competing with like 5 other people,"Craigslist.  Saw it 2 hours after it was posted.  Asked to buy.  two hours later guy said it's sold.

I ask how late was I.

,"Unlike the other people, you could place a higher value on your time and just buy a new one or a more expensive used one."
,Nothing to agree or disagree with there. It's commonly accepted that people should use office chairs for gaming.

Can you help me which Haworth is this?,"Hi, 
I am from Europe, it's not that easy to find bargins in here. This is for 50‚Ç¨, do you guys think it is worth it?"
,"very good deal i think, is a haworth lively"
,"I bought this Amia second hand for pretty cheap. I forgot to test the arms before bringing it home. It seems like they are screwed in place. It almost seems like it was made that way. When I take the screw out it can be adjusted up and down, but it isn't stable w/o the screw."
,"On my Series 2 (with 4D armrest) there is a screw at the same place, it is only use to remove the armrest.

Maybe [this video](https://youtu.be/HX7x3PDBXtg?t=95) can help ?"
Steelcase Discount w/ Work Worth it?,"Hi all, I receive 40-50% discount on all Steelcase products via work. After some research, I believe the Leap will probably be best for me (can always return if necessary). After tax, the chair in my configuration (Era, Hardwood, 4D) comes out ~ $750. 

I know Crandall and local deals might get the chair for a bit lower. Is this something I should jump at, or look to the used market?"
,"My two cents would be if you could get 40-50% off a brand new chair directly from the source you should just hop on that opportunity. Not knocking the used/refurb sellers at all, they're great, but I would like to imagine most people only go the used/refurb route because they're on a budget and its a way of saving \~50% off retail. But if it was the difference of only 5-10% most would opt for brand new all day. But maybe that's just me.  
Also if you like a specific Era fabric color, that's a relatively new line and I would think would be very difficult to find in the used/refurb world. Especially since most re-upholster their chairs with aftermarket fabrics anyway.  
Hope this helps you make the decision that works best for you.

,I would buy the Gesture if you have a 40-50% off the chair. The Gesture is their flagship chair and will always be better for some people. Try the two chairs out and return the one you don‚Äôt like. Crandall‚Äôs chair are either refurbished or they are factory returns from Steelcase that doesn‚Äôt have a warranty.
,used market expect a leap to be $50-$350.
Need advice from Steelcase Gesture owners,"I recently got a Gesture from Amazon and found that the padding/fabric is bunched up a bit around the sides of the seat of the chair. Is this normal? Amazon offered to give me a partial refund if I keep it and if it's normal, then I am definitely going to take it.

,"Hmm, can you attach a link to a picture? My gesture is 6 years old and I don‚Äôt believe it has this issue"
,Pics?
,It's normal.
,"If you bought the chair directly from Amazon on Amazon (as in amazon was the seller) and not an authorized 3rd party seller on Amazon, odds are it was a return from one of their Warehouses. Which is essentially equivalent to shopping at an outlet mall that only stocks sub par leftover inventory or returns from the regular stores. (Ie, shirts where one sleeve is slightly longer than the other, or the stitching on the collar is a little frayed, etc.)  


Amazon has been violating Steelcase's MAP (minimum advertised price) pretty bad selling their products below what their authorized retailers are allowed to sell for. This is a major problem and ruins the integrity and value of the brand which is why many name Brands and Manufacturers are starting to leave Amazon. Most people just see a cheaper price and hit buy not knowing its cheaper for a reason. I believe (not 100% positive yet) Steelcase is starting to announce they they are no longer honoring Warranty claims on chairs that come  from Amazon Warehouse sellers because there have been countless complaints about the quality.   


Ontop of that, now Amazon is disabling our listings here and there saying our prices are too high as if we're price gouging when we are selling at the lowest possible price we are contractually obligated to adhere to. Very frustrating.

Do you expect a drop in retail price of high-end chairs if a recession hits?,"So I'm planning to buy an Aeron. I would like to buy new and I understand the prices of those chairs are justified given they are chairs for life. I also used those chairs for years at work. Now on the other hand, I know those chairs have been going up and up in prices in conjunction of the bull run we had (i.e. hand in hand with tech stock), and now I'm wondering if we will see huge discounts of retail prices if a recession hits? what's your thoughts?

&#x200B;

Note: I understand there will be even more second hand if a recession hits, I'm just interested in price change of brand new.

Note #2: I also understand that no one knows when and if a recession hits (its peak)"
,I would expect a price increase around the new year regardless.  Used prices would definitely drop. Dealers would price more competitively not sure how online retail would price. List price is unlikely to go down.
,"I wouldn‚Äôt count on the recession from lowering the price of your Aeron. If anything the price will go up and the recession is nothing new that HM hasn‚Äôt deal with multiple times before and they are still strong. Their price of their stocks suck but that‚Äôs another story. If anything inflation would drive the price even higher. Also, HM doesn‚Äôt mass reproduce their chair anymore. It seems like they make them when they are being sold so they won‚Äôt make one unless it‚Äôs being sold and that why the lead times are so great."
,Do you remember what happened in 2008
Slightly unbalanced Leap v2,"I bought a used Leap v2 not long ago, but when I brought it home, left side of armrest was hitting the desk while right side stayed 1/4"" lower, so I put level on my seat and left side is slightly higher than right side. Is there possible repair?"
,"All Leap chairs have this. It's due to the screwing tolerances of the arms. Even though they are the same size mold, building them with the small tolerances that are intruduced while tightening the screws in the holes will cause them to be slightly off. 

Mine are also off by 1/4"" or so. When one touches the underside of my desk the other one has a little space between. Not enough for a finger but definitely there. 

You can take apart the arms and try screwing them down again more carefully. I've heard this can improve or eliminate the variance."
,Looks like an Autonomous Kinn piece of crap.
,I've never seen it and I certainly don't recognize the manufacturer as one of the serious ergonomic guys.
,Herman miller makes is suspension seating material using a premium oriented monofilament calls Hytrel. If the elastomer isn‚Äôt a TPE (thermoplastic elastomer) it‚Äôs not going to last.
,The chair you posted is the ergo pro from autonomous. It‚Äôs a knock off Embody and fern. I would pass on it.
Should I switch to the Sidiz T50 coming from a Herman Miller Sayl?,"I got these sayls for over a year now and while they do feel very premium, ventilated, minimal and comfy (especially the backrest), I find it really small for me since when I straighten my posture, the upper part of my back exceeds the backrest, so I‚Äôm forced to kinda slouch to make my back lean on the backrest. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8-5‚Äô9, relatively lightweight too. Would the Sidiz T50 be a good replacement for me? I saw them at around $240-250 at FB Marketplace."
,You would be downgrading a lot going with the T50 or the T80. The Sayl is a far superior chair so you will be let down if you transition to the T50/80.
,I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1 and I bought the gaming Sayl for my wife and I have the Logitech Embody and I have no problems fitting in the chair.

Warped/uneven Leap V2 from Crandall,"Recently, I purchased a refurbished Steelcase Leap V2 from Crandall furniture. 

After it arrived and I set it up and sat upon it, I realized that the back is pretty warped. I know that, due to the plastic, this often happens with this chair but that, usually, it doesn't negatively impact sitting (I've watched the video Crandall has on YouTube). However, the back feels so uneven that, when sitting, the left half of my upper back comes into contact with the chair before the right. In fact, the right side of upper back doesn't really feel supported by the chair, and for to have even contact across my whole back, I have to sit crooked. The back also doesn't seem to be evening out when I sit on it/put my weight onto it. 

The chair is also a bit noisy, making creaking noises when I move and recline. This issue is a bit less concerning to me but, combined with the above warping issues (that impact the chairs comfort), it's disappointing.

I emailed them and, while they replied to me promptly the next day, the response was a bit frustrating. In the email I sent them, I was clear that I was aware that the warped back was common with these chairs, but noted that I worried that this was more than an aesthetic issue and that the chair forces my posture into a non ideal position. In their reply to me, there was no apology about the chair, and I was told that ""Because the Leap V2 is such a flexible chair, what you are experiencing¬†is not abnormal"", and given a link to the video Crandall made on the V2 warped back. I was also told that it was common for any chair that reclines to need additional lubrication, and was given a video guiding me how to lubricate the chair. 

I found this reply frustrating because I think I was pretty clear that the warping for the chair causes discomfort and wasn't just an aesthetic issue, but I was told that my experience was fine/normal. It is also disappointed that, immediately upon receiving a chair I spent $600 on, I already need to lubricate it. I know this is a refurbished chair, so I imagined I'd have to lubricate it in a few months or years, but not immediately upon its arrival. Ultimately, for the amount I paid, I was expecting a chair that provides equal support of both the left and right side of my back. I also had hoped that, if I ended up having problems with the chair, customer service would be more receptive to my concerns. 

I'm hoping that this was just a matter of miscommunication. They did welcome me to send in a video so they could see if there was something further going on, which I will send. I also reiterated that, and tried to more clearly state that the warping of the chair isn't evening out and causing discomfort (still, I'm a bit irritated that the response to ""this seems like more than an aesthetic issue: the chair forces my posture into a not great position"" was ""this is normal""). I'm worried that, if I do end up being able to get a replacement, it will have the same or additional issues. 

For others who have got refurbished leap v2s, if you've had a warped back did it impact your comfort to this degree? Did you chair make noises right away?

I've tried to take some photos demonstrating the unevenness that I feel, but I'm not sure if they're adequately capturing the problem. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/1u78QZs

Video of noise: https://imgur.com/gallery/x7HnF0X

UPDATE: After sending photos and reiterating that the back of the chair doesn't even out, I was told that there is nothing seen that looks abnormal for the Leap. I was also told that, if I'm not loving the chair, or if I don't think it's a good fit, I can return it within the 30 day return window. So, I guess I'll just be returning the chair, which is disappointing."
,They shouldn‚Äôt have sent that out. These are +$1000 chairs MSRP. You can reasonably demand excellence here.
,"They‚Äôre all like that. At least‚Ä¶ according to me. I‚Äôve seen numerous people say the same thing, and there are also videos online about it. Something to do with the positioning of the lumbar stiffness dial.

I returned two and received a total of three chairs before I gave up on the Leap v2. Seems their QC sucks. Got an Embody instead lol."
,"I haven‚Äôt bought from Crandall because I found a good deal in my neighborhood when I was in the market a few years ago. But I believe they are true to their word and probably the most service oriented - because of how often the owner puts his name out there. I respect that. 

Having said that - it does look kind of bad, I would be sad too üòî"

\- I currently use a gaming chair, but it doesn't raise up high enough. (When my desk is at its lowest position, the chair is just slightly too low to have a good angle in my arms). I do like the cushion on the lower back though. Otherwise no issue."

Workpro replacement arm pads?,"I have a pretty good condition Workpro 9000, and there are a ton of replacement armpads, but none that I could find specifically for that range of chairs. Anyone have either the 5000 or 9000 and found any? I am also wondering if they are even easily replaceable."
Haworth Zody Recline Failure,"I have a Haworth Zody chair that I purchased from an auction a few months back (I think I posted about it here back then). Anyway, the chair is in pretty good shape, other than the recline feature not working. If you sit in it, it will take you back to the most extreme recline angle. I tried to adjust the tension and also take it apart and inspect it, I don't see anything broken, but back then a few others reported the same issue. So it seems to be a failure point with these chairs.

I tried to use an inflatable bladder device to wedge in between the bottom of the seat and the support that is on top of the hydraulics. Unfortunately, that didn't stay in place well. I hate to throw the chair out, but it is unusable the way it is.

I had thought about taking it to a welding shop, and having them weld it in the full upright position (Which would be just right for me)  to see if it would make the chair usable again. 

Just wondering if anyone had any experience with these chairs and would know of a way to keep them from reclining. Thanks in advance."

,"My wife and I are traveling to see a medical specialist and this is about an hour away from here. It's in the opposite direction we need to travel but after looking for these and on Crandall office refurb it seems like a good deal. Would like to confirm. 

In 2012 I broke 8 vertebrae so I know I would need to add a headrest and would like to upgrade the lumbar. So ergonomic is what I'm looking for.  I think that is possible and still be under the crandall costs."
,"It's a fair price if the condition is good.  

Aeron is a very popular chair and might be a good fit for you, but not sure how it will interact with  the medical issues you mentioned."
,Good price to me if it has working tilt limiter and even better if it has forward tilt.
Second hand Haworth Fern?,"Is it just in my area, Knoxville, TN that there just does not seem to be any used Haworth Fern for sale or are they just not very common? I‚Äôve seen pretty much all the other high to mid tier chairs in one place or another but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen even one Fern before. 

I‚Äôve been thinking of trying to pick one up for a while now but have yet to pull the trigger on anything new.. if you read this far, what‚Äôs the general consensus on the headrest vs no headrest for these? I‚Äôve read in plenty of place that digital knit is the way to go generally but the headrest seems to be a mixed bag. 

Appreciate any insight!"
,"Dont get the headrest. Also the digital knit is very new, so the chance you find one used will be slim to zero IMO."
Are there any decent casters with low-profile wheels that will fit the Steelcase Gesture?,"I'm using a seat cushion with a Gesture to sit slightly higher so that the headrest hits in the optimal location. (If you're under 5'8"", it tends to push your head forward when you bring it down). This brings the seat height up a bit though, and I might want it to be slightly lower, especially when reclining. 

Are there any low-profile casters out there which will take .5"" - 1"" off the seat height but are still able to move easily across medium carpet?"
,">Are there any low-profile casters out there which will take .5"" - 1"" off the seat height but are still able to move easily across medium carpet?

Doubtful. The cylinder is only 0.5"" off the ground to start with. If you lower the base through lower casters then your cylinder will just punch a hole in your carpet. 

Most people using Steelcase chairs on medium pile carpet are looking for **taller** casters so their cylinders don't drag on the carpet."
Steelcase Series 1 or what under $500?,"I've posted a couple times now asking questions similar to this but in all seriousness, I keep getting stuck in the rabbit hole. 6'0 tall 200 pounds.

I ordered a half priced Sydiz t50 for $189 but it got ""lost"" in China after waiting half a month and now I'm just f\*cking pissed because I'm still stuck with the same cheap ass flattened out Costco chair I began with.

Help please. I just want all the decent features a good ergo chair has; seat depth adjust(a must), decent lumbar, headrest addition potential( I'd order a headrest separately for the series 1 ) I'm about ready to say fuck it all and get the series 1 but I've heard its a bit petite for 5'11-6'0+ range

&#x200B;

Edit: If it helps any of you guys make a recommendation, I spend 8+ hours sitting as an IT professional but also invested into a standing flexispot desk which evidently helped a lot with posture. Nevertheless, my cheap costco chair still doesn't cut it; the cushion has flattened out, its especially bad for my posture because of  my long legs, as it lacks depth adjustment"

"United Chair Co., Inc. history?","Hi all!

I am wondering if you might be able to help me learn a bit more about a chair I‚Äôm looking to purchase online. 

It says it was made by the United Chair Co., Inc. in Bruce, MS. If I search for ‚ÄúHighway 9 South, Bruce, MS‚Äù, I get information mentioning Haworth. I‚Äôve also read that Haworth acquired a United Chair Co. (Leeds, AL) in the mid-90‚Äôs but I am not sure if it is one and the same. That still would not make this chair of Haworth-related quality per se. 

Anyways, really just trying to find out what I can about this chair! Wondering if it‚Äôs a steal and prized find or just your average 90‚Äôs task chair."
,"I don't know what they were like in the 90's, but the only United chair I've tested, the Affinity, felt cheap and flimsy."

Things escalate quickly when you stumble upon this sub! Leap v1 FB find for $15 (+$290 worth of Crandall rejuvenation),"I went from a little sad, to super pumped. My antique wooden office chair that I've been using for years finally broke. It was pretty basic, but really comfortable for me. 

Started researching office chairs, and found this sub. Never really expected to spend all that much, was just looking to see if there were brands to look out for.

So after hours of scrolling this sub, I spent hours scrolling FB marketplace hoping to find something decent. Happened upon this one without the brand listed, but she said it was ""a good brand"". It's from 2001, and the fabric appropriately... gross, but everything is working correctly. 

My wife is also appropriately confused at my utter excitement of getting a new chair, lol.

Got the new bits on order, and can't wait!

Anyway, cheers and thanks to all the folks contributing here."
,"Always great to hear people funding a bargain somewhere! Leap V1s are well built and last a long time, should be good for a while longer for you"

,"Info that helps us make accurate recommendations include, but are not limited to:

* your budget, preferred and max

* your height

* your weight

* any unusual bodily proportions (such as long torso, short arms, etc.)

* what you do and how you sit in your chair (including whether you're looking to improve your posture or accommodate poor/unusual postures)

* your current chair and any pain/discomfort associated with sitting in it

Looking for a chair,"I‚Äôll be WFH soon, and looking for a new office chair with the works: adjustable seat/back height, padded armrests, tilts and swivels. A headrest would be nice too but not a must have.

600 euro chain in the EU,"Hi guys, as the title says I would like some suggestions for a chair to buy, however I am based in Europe and I need the receipt for my employer so no second hand/facebook marketplace for me unfortunately - if I could get it on [Amazon.de](https://Amazon.de) or Czech Eshops that would be ideal.  


I was looking at the HM Verus, however I have found out that its not an European Company, LOL!. I was trying to get something like the Ahrend 2020 and similar but for some reason its kinda hard to buy if you are not a big company."
,"You're in luck my friend. Check my last post, Amazon Europe is now selling Steelcase and they're first party sold (by Amazon) which means 30 day returns, VAT refund directly at checkout (if your company has a business account), and most important of all, full warranty of 3y (EU-mandated) + standard Steelcase warranty (which I have no idea if it's high like in the States but should be).

You'll have to go to lower-midrange models such as the reply, but take a look. I won't link it as I don't want to be promoting Amazon anymore than I already did, but you can check my post just yesterday or just look for the chair yourself.

Correction: their only cheap, in your range chairs now seem to be the series 1 and 2 unfortunately, and the series 2 may be stretching it at 690 (with VAT) but you have to see if your budget is with or without VAT."

Bonded leather cracks and flakes after a year or two and mesh is just plain uncomfortable in my opinion. I'm looking for one that's similar to the Serta Hensley, but in fabric, not bonded leather. I'm really tired of bonded leather, but it's like the ONLY option for a lot of the chairs I'm looking at."

Steelcase Leap v2 or something else?,I‚Äôm looking for a good ergo chair for gaming/work with a budget of $300. I found a used Steelcase leap v2 online for $240. Is this a good deal or are there better alternatives like buying something brand new rather than used?

How do i clean my steelcase leap v2 without a shopvac?,"I've been using this refurbished steelcase leap v2 for about two years, but after a summer of sweating on it, it's starting to smell.

I went on steelcase's site and their procedure they reccomend requires a shop vac which i don't have nor can i afford to buy, is there an alternative? i'm fine with leaving the chair to air dry for a few days or more, as long as it gets the smell out.
Oh and i don't know what type of fabric it is exactly, i tried contacting the seller but he doesn't know, and there's no label under the chair that i can see."

This is what I personally use and it is fantastic, feel free to have a look through some of the chair restoration videos I posted here for an idea. I think it comes with some solution that you can use as well. I also use a drill with a very soft cleaning brush for stains.

Edit: taking a look on google it looks like there are some cheaper wet shop vacs that you may be able to use, but they don‚Äôt come with the water sprayer. You could always just use a spray bottle and then use the vacuum after"

Standard height range for lumbar support,"I was just wondering if anyone knew what the standard height for a chairs lumbar support is - and measure their own chair if possible.

I got the steelcase gesture a few days ago and it hurts my back like crazy. I think the lumbar support is way too low (Im 6""2'), but looking at images of other high end ergonomic chairs, all their lumbar supports look about the same.

&#x200B;

So for me:

The most pushed out part of the gestures back is about 18cm off the seat, while the most recessed part of my lower spine is a much higher 28cm off the seat.

&#x200B;

Am I just not used to ""correct"" lumbar support, or is it actually too low for me?"

Who knew finding a good chair would be so hard? Help!,"The past week I have embarked on a quest for a new chair after a failure in an old crappy bucket seat. Little did I know shopping for a chair would be the most ridiculous thing i have ever done.

Ive basically come to the conclusion that the best option is to spend 1k+ on a Haworth/HM/Steelcase, but im curious if the sub has thoughts on some of these cheaper options (sub $500). Looking for something comfortable to lounge and sit in different positions for long hours. Headrest is a must. And i would prefer something with a good warrantly and build quality. I see a lot of ergonomic chairs in this range that I fear are more geared towards proper posture than comfortability over long periods of time.

My top choices right now are

HON Ignition 2.0
Clatina Mellet

I'd be curious to hear if the sub thinks either of these options would fit my needs. Or maybe some other recommendations that I haven't found yet. My research seems to be bringing me back to the same 10 chairs (kudos marketing teams) and I'm struggling to find any deep cuts that could be reliable options.

,"I got an HM Aeron V1 off ebay and haven't had back issues since. 

You and I are the same size. I'm 10-15 lbs heavier depending on the week. You can get a headrest on amazon that looks OEM.

,"The [9to5 Seating Strata 1580](https://officechairsoutlet.com/products/strata-1580?variant=42764117016819) with headrest and highly adjustable cushioned armrests at $600 has a similar warranty to Haworth - lifetime warranty except 5 years on fabric and foam. I find it particularly comfortable and it's just the right size for you to sit in healthy posture but with room to spare for alternate seated positions. The lumbar support is tension-adjustable. The headrest is perfect, out of the way while upright and comfy while reclining.

The Mellet is a fantastic value option and just barely fits you, but its quality is noticeably less premium than any higher-end chairs.

The HON Ignition 2.0 is comfy but creaky."
,"I just went through this journey over the last few weeks. It's shockingly hard to find a decent chair for \~$500. I was very settled on the Haworth Soji, and overnight they jacked up the prices over a $100. After that I startled looking at the Steelcase Series 1 and 2. The reviews on those are kind of iffy and the series 1 is probably too small for you. 

I ended up ordering an Authorized Factory Return Steelcase Amia from Crandall Furniture for $650 (normally around $1000). It's supposed to be in like new condition. It's actually arriving today, so I can't say how it is. But so far it's been a good experience, it shipped really quickly (I ordered Friday night). Maybe check out some of the returns. They're not refurbished or re manufactured, they're more of an open box thing.

Also I noticed that the HON ignition is 60% off for prime day and super cheap. When I was looking it was like around $400."
,"I got a serta iComfort with my stimulus check at the beginning of lockdown.  Best $500 I ever spent.  I'm 6' and the chair is still a little tall for me even, but the air bladder lumbar support has become a feature I cannot live without.  I must have sat in this chair for 6000+ hours already."
,"I have a Mellet and some people in my office have the Ignition v1, all the arm wrests on them are cracked and a few people said the tension for the tilt is broken. There are more functional chairs than broken however. I ended up with the Mellet because they told me I could only spend $250 on a chair. I guess the new admin has a different budget than the old one. I can say, the Mellet is a great task chair but a terrible lounge chair. If I were at home or gaming I would take the Ignition. The wider more cushioned seat would be great for relaxing. I have a fabric Union and Scale Kroy at home and the iginition reminds me a bit of that."

Best sub $200 chair‚ÄîCostway branded Clatina Mellet,"Received my Costway Chair! (exactly the same as the Clatina Mellet)

A couple of the parts even say ‚ÄúMellet‚Äù on them so I‚Äôm fairly confident it‚Äôs the exact same as the Clatina. Even spoke with Costway and the CS rep said they could be the same since they use an overseas manufacturer. 

Highly recommend buying from Costway instead of Clatina/Furngo.

,"Very satisfied with mine so far -- trialed multiple premium chairs but felt like none of them were worth the 1k+ price tags new except for maybe the Embody, which at almost $2k right now isn't what I want to pay for especially without a headrest.  The Fern's curve (not adjustable) didn't fit my back, but that was a good chair too.   
&nbsp;

Paid $180 for the Costway mellet model (fabric with headrest).  It's not amazing, but the build quality is better than Staples chairs and it's a comfortable seat and back experience.  I really wanted a chair with a headrest and the headrest on this one is very good (adjusts up and down and rotated in an arc, nicely padded and stays in place.  BTOD did a video comparing headrests and this one scored highly).  The armrests are too hard and are only 3D (doesn't adjust forward or back, which is annoying when I want to move them away from the desk).  The tilt tension on at least the one I got is far too high, at the lowest setting it requires some effort still to push back with my legs instead of just leaning back, but I am not a large bodied person.

&nbsp;

Came in 1 box (including headrest) that was branded Costway, the same with the manual.  One caveat for buying the Costway version from Target is that it only has a 90-day warranty, whereas OP found out buying directly from Costway gives you a 1-year warranty."

Disassembly of Wilkhahn Solis ?,"Hey guys!

Haworth zody vs Fully desk chair,"I have the fully (with a headrest) and I like it and I'm planning on getting 1 more chair for another room. In my country the zody costs around 200$ more(700$) than the fully.

My main concerns are with the sitting comfort and the cushion's durability. I would like to be able to sit in it for many hours at a time and the cushion not getting deformed after few years. I assume a firmer seat would last longer? (it seems to me judging by pictures that the fully has a thicker cushion although I'm not sure about firmness differences).

Admiral by Realm of Thrones Durability,"How is the build quality and durability of the Admiral?

"Terrible experience with the steelcase leap, looking for suggestions","My steelcase leap arrived over the weekend and Monday was my first full workday in it. By noon I was feeling rather uncomfortable in the lower back area, and by three o'clock it was so bad I switched back to my old chair. Not sure what exactly went wrong, but its as if the part near my waist and just above the tailbone got zero support and was left hanging. Anyhow I'm pretty sure this chair isn't for me. 

Looking for suggestions. I'm 5'3, 130 pounds, and sit for longer than 8 hours on weekdays due to wfh. I've never had back pain or any discomfort with any chair though, so mainly looking for more comfort. My workspaces all had aerons which I really like but the size b is to tall for me ( I can't comfortably rest my feet on the ground at the lowest height Ôºâand the size a doesn't allow me to sit crossed legged since the seat is narrower and aeron has a hard trim around the seat...  Any ideas for chairs that would work for a short person, ideally with a cushioned seat? The leap's seat felt pretty good."
,"There is definitely a break in period for these higher end chairs, the seat is going to be firmer than you are used to on more budget chairs -especially if you purchased the chair new. 

However, in any chair it‚Äôs rather unhealthy and unrealistic expecting to be comfortable without taking any breaks. It‚Äôs best to get up every couple of hours to do other things, and give yourself a break. You may be doing this but the post comes off as you are sitting in the chair nonstop for 6+ hours.

I would try the leap for a bit longer, make sure you have everything adjusted as comfortable as you can make it, the lumbar on the leap was always a bit uncomfortable for me so you may even want to try removing it.

As for other suggestions, if you aren‚Äôt a fan of the seat on the leap you may like the aeron as someone else has mentioned. I personally use a gesture, after owning a leap I find this one to just be more comfortable for me - but others feel differently. I Also have tried the embody, if you don‚Äôt like aggressive lumbar this might be the best fit for you - but it is very pricy"
,"I use a size A Aeron I am 5'4"" 170lbs. I still have to use a foot rest because my desk is just a bit too tall. I just cut some foam exercise matt puzzle squares into a good foot rest shape and stacked them, then taped/skewered them together. 

Have you adjusted the lumbar support and seat pan depth on your leap? My leap v2, I got used, supports my lower back pretty well as long as I have the seat as far back as it can go. I usually use my leap with the seat more forward because I use it for my project desk and I am usually working over something rather than typing on a keyboard looking at a screen.

Haworth Zody / Fern might be good options."
,Haworth Zody should be a good fit for you and offers more sacral support than the Leap.
,"If your seat pan isn‚Äôt set correctly it can lead to excruciating discomfort in the pelvic girdle area. I‚Äôm surprised to hear all these break in times posts, yea‚Ä¶. But this product has half a dozen handles and levers and it may not be obvious how to set these correctly."

European Sub'ers - Steelcase now selling directly to consumer through Amazon Europe shops,"You can now find a ""Steelcase shop"" with products sold by Amazon directly, at prices which seem lower than the advertised MSRPs. Here's an example for Amazon Spain:

[https://www.amazon.es/stores/Steelcase/page/A48B423F-2A74-443F-9A5C-4C7578F24AB2](https://www.amazon.es/stores/Steelcase/page/A48B423F-2A74-443F-9A5C-4C7578F24AB2?ref_=ast_bln)

(also in France and Germany apparently) 

  
I find it bittersweet to have to promote Bezos in the sub, but given the difficulty we European customers have finding and dealing directly with refurbishers or regional brand representatives that focus on B2B such as Steelcase/Haworth/Herman Miller, and the stupid practices I've seen them use for end user sales (stupid prices, no discounts, scant options...), I thought that this would be relevant to a lot of you.

Amazon also has a return a very generous return policy, although I digress if it works fine (and no-questions-asked/free..:) with these large products.

They have an unusually above average range of (in-stock!) models and colors, with headrest options even for the Gesture, Leap v2, Please v2 (but not the air, probably that one doesn't have it), even some lower end models such as Reply and Series1-2.

**Notably missing is the Amia** (and to a lesser extent, the Think)**.** I never tried it but it is a popularly praised chair as an alternative for the Gesture/Leap v2, not only in cost but also in some argonomics such as a better backrest. I strongly suggest you try the Please instead for the later (price is, unfortunately, at Leap/Gesture levels for this). The Reply might also be a better choice for cost, since the Series 1-2 are badly priced and bad chairs from what I've seen online across multiple sources.

u/ibuyofficefurniture here's one you can probably reference. Not the best option there is, but certainly makes things more accessible for EU users.

Update: the Reply seems to be gone, and now there are multiple models of the Think (?). My guess is this store is likely controlled by Steelcase themselves so stock could be changing really, REALLY fast depending on their own warehouse. So today they may have 50 gestures and tomorrow they may have 100 leaps and no gestures, because they fulfilled some order and another didn't pan out or something. If only they sold these a bit cheaper..."

Steelcase Please questions,"Hey guys,

I am currently debating getting a Steelcase Please, mainly because I like the idea of being able to recline while still having lumbar support. However I have a few questions, mainly because it's just a chair that's not being talked about much and ""Please"" is not exactly an ideal name for a search query. 

I've had an IKEA Markus for around 10 years now, so I am finally looking to upgrade. If anyone has some other suggestions I am also happy to hear them.

1. How good/bad is the ventilation in the backrest and seat? I tend to get quite warm in summer and the mesh on the Markus is quite helpful with that, but it's also just not that comfortable.
2. How hard is the seat? I have been sitting on the Markus with two additional pillows (One of those silicone gel ones and another normal one on top) for years now. From what I have gathered, the Please cushion also seems to be quite thin?
3. I sit in weird positions sometimes, will the please still allow me to do that or is it one of those ""forcing you into posture"" chairs like the Aeron?
4. Almost all used ones come with armrests, which I absolutely hate, but it looks like there is not really an easy way to remove them on the Please. Or is it not possible to remove them at all? Worst case I might just saw them off, but that doesn't exactly seem like a good solution...

Hope there are at least some Please owners here who can give me some feedback on these points!"
,"Please V2 isn't available in north America you might find better help on an European forum.  Judging from stock photos the arms don't look removable, maybe similar to leap that part of the arm can be removed."
,"I had a Please v1 and recently bought a v2. Both used.

1. I'd say the ventilation is not good. Maybe it's because of the quality of the fabric, which is this [rough fabric](https://i.imgur.com/6N1A5uD.png) on my unit. This fabric can also causes itching if you wear short shorts and it touches your leg.
2. The seat cushion on the v2 is not as thick as I remember my v1 had. I think back then they didn't follow this notion that thin seat pad is better for ergonomics. But, as I said, my unit is a used one and I can definitely tell that there's a dip in the middle. Maybe it's by design? I don't know. There was time when I wished it was softer, but right now as I sit in it, it's fine. Before this, I sat in an old Steelcase LetsB on which the seat was bottoming out heavily. Compared to that, this one is definitely better and I don't feel tailbone pain right now.
3. it doesn't force you into a position since it has a relatively flat seat, aside from the dip which was probably caused by years of sitting.
4. The armrest can't be removed since it's [interconnected](https://i.imgur.com/kGcgrFB.png) with the lumbar portion of the backrest. I mean you could remove the armrest itself by force with a hammer or something (you can't just lift it off while holding the adjustment button) but then you'll have a stub in the open which is not very safe. You can lower the armrest however and they will not touch your arms.

Overall, I think it's a great chair. It has a lumbar support like none other. I love how it follows my back when I recline and move my hip forward and up to have an ideal curve in back. What I also love about the recline is that you can just set it to free recline and lean back to any degree you want, and the counter-force will help you stay there but it won't push you forward."
Killer lower back pain with Herman Miller Aeron. Any tips?,"I have a very basic medium size Aeron that I was so excited to have and use but after spending long days in this chair when I stand up I have this sharp lower back pain right above my tailbone. 

The version I have is a very basic one that just goes up and down and can tighten or loosen how easy it reclines and doesn't have the lumbar support insert thing... With so many rave reviews about this chair, I figured it would be an end all be all for me but it's starting to give me problems. 

Any suggestions on how I can improve this chair or suggestions on a chair that may be a better fit for someone with lower back pain issues? 

Thanks!"
,Is your butt sitting against the back plastic part of the chair seat?  Maybe you didn't get a large enough size or your sitting too far back in the chair.

When is the best time to buy a chair?,"I've been planning on upgrading from a \~$200 'gaming chair' for about a year now, and now that I have a better-paying job (that requires me to sit at my desk 8 hours a day), I'm planning on picking up a chair soon, so I come to you wise folks for some advice.

With Black Friday and the general Christmas shopping season on the horizon, will there be good sales for high-end chairs?

If so, do you think it would be smarter to pickup a chair during the sales, or to wait a few weeks afterwards and try and pick up the newly listed used chairs that individuals are replacing with chairs that they got during the sales?

What are some good chairs for me to keep an eye out for and at what price points are they in the, ""wow, this is a good deal"" category and I should strongly consider picking them up at?

Really Dislike the Steelcase Gesture,"Got my steelcase gesture today. Thought id share some thoughts on it, as ive really not liked it and sadly will have to go through the effort of repackaging and returning it - really not happy about having to repackage all this and cart it downstairs without a delivery driver helping this time, but its just not worth the asking price for me.

Interested to hear if people have solutions to any of my issues (including new chair reccomendations - considering the embody atm, maybe leap v2), or if you experienced similar issues to mine.

Context:

* I bought the chair on amazon, with headrest. The price was very reasonable compared to other buying options out there (I'm in the UK). It took about 1 month to arrive.
* Im 6""2', 65kg
* My old chair was a ¬£300 HJH chair that I probably spent a bit of a premium on just because I liked how it looked [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00O09ZM14/ref=twister\_B00VNQMTL8](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00O09ZM14/ref=twister_B00VNQMTL8)

The Great:

* Honestly the single biggest thing that I really like on this chair compared to my current, is that **the recline doesnt lift my legs far off the ground** (due to the 2:1 recline on the seat pan). My understanding is that this is common in high end chairs, and it makes the recline so much more enjoyable while maintaining good posture.

The Good

* The arms being so manuverable means **I can actually pull my chair in all the way** without having to lower the arms below the point where they no longer support my elbows. They are also very stable which while not essential does help make it feel higher quality.
* It is noticably more comfortable being able to pull the arm rests in to my actual sholder width - im a thin guy, on my old chair the arm rests are far too wide apart to be as comfortable as they could be

The OK

* I decided to try a headrest. Its ok, but honestly I think the main thing I gained from this chair is the 2:1 recline, **the headrest really isnt that big of an add or me**. It does also get in the way a little more than I would want, its annoying having to keep folding it back when not in use.
* The seat pad is barely any more comfortable than my current chair. It is often reccomended for being super comfortable but it just isnt. Its very firm. The flexible front of the seatpad does make it slightly nicer though.

The bad

* **The arm rests are unbearably painful.** I rarely ever wear long sleaves, and have very bony elbows. After 8 hours in this thing, I HAD to switch back to my old chair because **my elbows felt bruised**. I've heard them described as ""a bit more firm than I would like"", but they're like solid bricks of rubber - barely better than solid plastic.
* **The lumbar support is non existant.** Again, 8 hours later, my back hurts - my lumbar feels like it does after a long time sitting in a very bad position. Maybe id get used to it? But the flex back technology means that it provides very little resistance as you lean back into it. The included lumbar support barely does anything, slightly shifting where a very small amount of resistance can be felt. Old chair back is basically flat, but ill often super-curve my lumbar and use the friction of my upper back against the seat to keep my lumber like that - doing this as I type to help with the discomfort caused by the gesture."
,"I'm also tall and slim, and thankfully Gesture fits quite well for me. I love the arm rests and don't get any issues with my somewhat bony arms. Backrest is ok, I frankly expected something a bit more supportive I think but I can comfortably sit on the chair a long day with zero issues so I guess that counts as a good fit.

I didn't get the headrest so no comments on that.

Just saying this as your experience could have scared me away when I was doing my chair research. I hope the next model you try fits you better!"
,"Sorry you had such a poor experience with the Steelcase Gesture. I hope you find something that works for you. This is another prime example that the everybody has different needs/expectations when it comes to a high quality ergonomic office chair and why it is very important to try before you buy whenever possible.

I personally have been temporarily using a Gesture in the office for about 4 months now with 8+ hours of sitting every day, and have had absolutely zero discomfort or pain with the arms/lumbar/seat.

\-Colin at TheBackStore"
,"I think it's too early to comment on a lot of your points.

My main comment would be to give it more time. If it isn't the chair for you that's fine, but it takes at least ~2 weeks to get a good feel for a chair and for your body to adjust to it.

https://youtu.be/oHyIwHhYLcU

Also make sure to adjust the settings to your body, and take some time to play around with what feels right."
,"The gesture has a pretty good and pronounce lumbar in my opinion. If you don‚Äôt like the gesture , I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll like the embody or the leap. The embody in my opinion has the least amount of lumbar support, while the leap has about the same amount of lumbar if not slightly more. I own all three and my favorite is the leap v2 but idk if any of the chairs will satisfy you. Also gesture and leap has the best arms in the ergo chair business‚Ä¶ I find them to be quite rigid at the same time comfy. The embody is a bit more cushy but you have a bit less settings."
,"If lumbar support is important, go with the Haworth Fern with lumbar pillow installed. I've said on this subreddit before that the Gesture, to me, is a pretty meh chair with exceptional build quality."
,"I didn't choose the Gesture because of it's the super loose lumbar support, ended up choosing a Fern instead for serious lumbar support."
,"I just got a leap v2 recently. I too had back pain when sitting in it for the first 3-4 days but now that I‚Äôve allowed my body to adjust it‚Äôs gone and I feel incredibly comfortable in it.

If you can, maybe give it a few extra days to let your body adjust to the new chair.

As far as the arm rests, I think there might be some padded covers that you can slip over the arm rests. I don‚Äôt have the same experience with my Leap."
,"It takes a while for your body to adjust to a chair (if you‚Äôre not used to an ergonomic design). I didn‚Äôt like my Gesture at all initially, but have grown to like it quite a bit. I never had the issue with arm rests being painful, though, so perhaps that‚Äôs your sign to try a different one."

,Does your chair wobble left and right
,"I'm a pretty big guy, and I'm reasonably happy with my Gesture, but I can see some of your complaints.

I can't entirely decide whether I like the armrest pads or not, but it is hard to deny what you say about the discomfort after using them for a while. I certainly can't just leave them immobile all day and expect no pain.

It was my understanding that the seat in particular wasn't winning any awards, but sometimes you'd run into publications both pointing this out, and also scoring the Gesture really high for comfort. Not sure how that squares, but I guess they were probably looking beyond the seat.

I can appreciate the armrest flexibility, but truthfully I'm wide enough that I feel like I can only use maybe half of the range.

I know what you mean about having to mess with the headrest a lot, but I've not found it to be an issue. It's quick to pull up or push out of the way as necessary, and adjustable and stays in place well enough when you want it to be that it's made me pretty happy.

The controls are pretty nice, which is good because I do find myself adjusting the back tilt tension pretty often. Sometimes I have to meet the chair halfway with that, but the result is that sometimes I can find that magical tension setting that allows me to both recline when I want, and sit up when I don't.

The lumbar support, I almost forget about most of the time. Not sure if that's good or bad.

The flexible plastic cover underneath the seat of my chair seems to squeak on one side. Not sure why that is, but at least it was pretty easy to find the offending component (can't say the same about my last squeaky chair).

Overall, I find that it gets me through long days without too much trouble, and at my size that's a blessing all its own.

The Leap might work well, better even, for a slim guy, but personally I knew pretty quickly that I preferred the Gesture to the Leap. Different strokes, I guess."
,"People have varying degrees of spinal curvature, resulting in differing lumbar support tension needs. If you're buying a chair online without testing it, it is so much safer to get one that has adjustable lumbar support tension, e.g. Leap, Zody, Very, Strata, etc."
,"Out of all the top chairs talked about in this community (aeron, leap, gesture, fern, embody, zody) - the gesture has the strongest and most pronounced lumbar. 

Fern with additional lumbar support might be around the same or a close second but gesture is quite strong. Most people return the gesture due to its very pronounced lumbar. 

I would‚Äôve kept it over the leap if the gesture had the flexible lumbar like the leap does. 

My guess is either yours is defective, it‚Äôs hitting an odd spot or you are defining lumbar support differently than most?"
,"I'm 6'5 195 and the Gesture seat was even worse for me. 

The Leap seat was too narrow for me and too short. Love the back on it tho. 

The Embody forces rounded shoulders and encourages poor posture if you're tall. If you were shorter, it could work. 

Worst case, try it. But pay attention to your shoulders."
,I go back and forth on the gesture... I agree with everything you said about it. Pretty spot on. Thanks for the review!
,"I'm not all too familiar with what's available in the UK, but this budget chair looks promising - https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08R39NHTF"
,Wait more than a fuckin day before writing an essay about it goddamn
,"I hate the wobble, and the fact that I always feel like I'm sliding off. In addition to also dealing with lower back pain. Did you return the chair or did you find any solutions?"
,"Hey I got the Gesture too and disliked it at first, thought of getting rid of it for reasons similar to ones you have listed

I do think I like it now. Here is what helped:

1. You should really consider how you are sitting in it. Overall the chair is very well designed, but it's a *tool to help you sit better for long periods of time.* Consider it as such. I mean getting a $1000+ chair only makes sense if you are willing to take full advantage of it, otherwise just sit on anything and deal wit the consequences.
   1. The height of the chair should be correct, so your knees are at 90 degrees angle max, otherwise your butt would press into the seat too much.
   2. **Very important** your butt should be all the way back against the backrest. Otherwise you aren't using the chair really. The backrest is really good and supportive (I am \~193lbs, so quite heavier than you). I hope you didn't get the one with ""Lumbar support"", the plastic thing - it's useless and is detrimental to the whole design. I had to pull it off. The backrest now has some give but just enough to give me amazing support. It's kinda soothing.
      1. I kept sliding forward on that chair, because of a smooth tech textile on my pants, so I got a jacquard cover and it stops the friction .
2. The worst part of Gesture for me is/was the seat pad. It's too hard. Unless you sit properly. If left to my own accord, I would naturally half-lay down, nearly horizontally with legs stretched out forward. There is no chair in the world that can accommodate that. With Gesture I actually seat normally and don't mind it. Now I did get a Purple Simply Cushion for it (all the others are too thick and mess up the ergonomics), and it's softer with it, but, frankly, it's much easier to just shift around every once in a while. Overall the best possible seat for me would have been true mesh, like Aeron, but a chair that is as adjustable as Gesture with a full mesh seat does not exist so I am ok with Gesture
3. Re: arm pads - if these seem too hard, maybe you haven't tried the soft ones, like Aeron. Those actually cut off circulation pretty badly, as your hands sink into them, instead of just resting on the surface, so you can fine-tune how deep you go into them. The arm rests are the most amazing thing about Gesture tbh and the reason I wouldn't trade it away"
,"I had a similar problem with the gesture after getting mine with the lumbar support. 

It's actually there and quite prominent! The issue lies to how your back aligns with the support. 

For sensitive backs it will take a bit of adjustment 1 week or so to get used to the lumbar support. 

Imagine your lower back working muscles they havent worked in a while. They will inflame and slowly adjust over a short period of time. 

Personally, leap is more comfortable. Significantly but I prefer gesture for home for lifestyle and leap for work. 

Gestures headrest is something that shines brightly over time once you find something that works for you. 

Just like its name, the chair is supposed to be the embodiment of your gesture. It's something you find comfortable over time rather than sitting down instantly and feeling like you are sitting on a cloud. 

It's built to support your unique postures that you fundamentally find yourself through out the day without realization instead of putting yourself into a perfect posture 100% of the time which isn't natural."

Budget ergonomic chair with adjustable lumbar and headrest.,"Hi y‚Äôall,

I have heard bad things about the ones on Amazon and I tried the OfficeDepot series 12000, which I felt okay, but people are also saying that it‚Äôs no good.

So I‚Äôm looking recommendations of a good good that is within my budget ($600), my requirements: mesh back, with adjustable lumbar and headrest.  No used or refurbished.

Thank you in advance!"
,"Probably mavix then. The lumbar and headrest arent mesh, but everything else is mesh"
,"What are your height and weight? Any disproportionately long or short torso, legs, and/or arms? This info is important because most office chairs aren't one size fits all, and headrest fit is particularly finicky."
,I would suggest the X chair personally or a Mavix.
Chair newbie - uncomfortable ergonomic chair,"Hey guys,   


I bought a new chair (Interstuhl Every Active) that arrived today and now I wonder if something is wrong with me or the chair. When I try using my new chair I immediately feel that it forces me to a hard almost ""attention-sitting military"" position and really pushes me forward, making it kinda uncomfortable. Also, I am sitting on my chair only for like 2 hours but I know that in the evening I will have a sore back, even more than on my previous cheap chair.    


Is it normal?  As you can imagine I am kinda disappointed as this is the first nice chair that I bought and that I wanted to use not only for work but also for leisure  


Before I had a horrible Sihoo M57 that literally was too small for me so I don't really have a good comparison."
,"If it's ""active sitting"" that might be why you're getting sore. It'd be working you out while sitting in it and you're not used to using those muscles to hold yourself up.

Could be a problem though? I've had a Hag Capisco for years and it's never really felt comfortable and i've NEVER gotten used to sitting in it comfortably. After being in it for even a couple hours my neck is burning and will be in serious pain at the end of the day.

Not sure if you might have a similar experience with this chair as it looks more like a normal chair"
Armrest Replacement Leap V1,I was wondering if there was a different option for leap v1 armrests. The stock ones are quite firm and i would love to get some softer ones. Is there any that people may know of? I checked crandall and they are built to oem specs and not sure how much softer they would be.
,"Hi, does the old cylinder have the same kind of actuator as the new cylinder?

Need advice on a used Embody I'm looking at,"They're selling it used for $750 used and the condition looks pretty good but it's from 2 years ago so it doesn't have the new scrim layer on it. Does the layer add that much or is it not a big deal? And is this an offer I should pull the trigger on?


Edit: I found a Logitech one that's new in box (at least that's what they say)2 for $1000 but is that worth it since it doesn't come with the 12 year warranty? Should I keep looking for a better deal?"
,Ive had both the original Embody and a 2021 Logitech one with added foam. Makes a huge difference for me and can't go back to the old one imo.
,"No, if it doesn‚Äôt have the new scrim layer on it."
,"Hey, I recently got regular Embody made in 2020. I prefer it to Logitech version because it‚Äôs more comfortable. Logitech made me feel like back was pushing my body away and pain. Are you getting warranty with 750$? If yes, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad deal."
Can to Steam Office Chair Seats to Restore Foam?,"I work in the automotive space and it‚Äôs not uncommon to steam the foam of old seats to get them to return to original dimensions.

Edit, apologies for the title type-o"
,"Yes! It won't last as long as a brand new seat, but you can steam treat repeatedly as necessary (2-3 times a year should be plenty)."
Looking for a new chair,"Good Evening!  


I'm looking to buy a good office chair that will be more comfortable and last longer than the comparative jank I'm used to.  


I'm 6'5"", 360lbs AToW, and looking for something that'll hold up for 10+ hours of sitting. I also tend to sit with minimal clothing (not sure if that would bias decisions towards leather or fabric).  


I've looked at the Steelcase Gesture, but the price is nearing 2.5K for leather, so a cheaper suggestion would be appreciated.   


Thank you in advance for taking the time to look and comment!"
,"Not exactly an office chair, but the andaseat chair costs a fraction and you cna pick up a big and tall https://youtu.be/B8exCq3ETU8"
,"Tallest chair I know is the steelcase please. My friend is 6'6"" and it fits him since the back can adjust upwards quite a long way. Try a used one and see if you like it. Also losing some weight would help"
,"I would avoid leather if you're sitting with minimal clothing. It may be easier to clean, but it will stick and cause you to sweat more."
,"I highly recommend the Serta Jennings and you can probably try it at Office Depot before buying.  It's rated for 10 hours a day and 400 lbs and I believe both those figures to be conservative (can confirm the time, I'm not at 400 but the chair also doesn't struggle at all under my weight).

Over the last 2 weeks I have tried nearly every Herman Miller and Steelcase chair and none of them were comfortable to me (I'm also a large guy in every direction).  Each had a fatal flaw.

I used the Jennings daily for 5 years at work and when I left, I left my chair there thinking I could invest in a better chair (the Jennings isn't exactly attractive and I wanted folding arms).  For me, I have not yet found a better chair, especially considering the price comparatively."
,"There is the Nightinggale CXO that would be a good fit for someone your weight. I don‚Äôt think the gesture is going to hold you up correctly but I could be wrong. Think about it this way, the CXO has a 12 yr warranty so it will likely be the last chair you‚Äôll ever need to buy and it‚Äôs not super expensive but it is cloth vs leather. It‚Äôs worth the investment considering how much time you‚Äôre spending in it. Good luck."

"Is the Haworth Fern a good pick for 6.1"" with lower back scoliosis?","As a background, I'm 6.1""/185cm and really thin (65 kg) and I have some lower back scoliosis. I tried the Leap v2 and now the Gesture and both get me lower back pain on the left side after a couple hours because I can tell my lower back tends to twist to the left, I guess due to the scoliosis. I have the extra lumbar (in the EU it comes standard) and it helps somewhat but doesn't fix the issue, tried \*a lot\* to adjust the seat height/depth as well.

I read that the Fern is a good option for scoliosis, how many people have tried it and can vouch for it? Any other suggestions? Thanks!"
,"The Fern moves around a lot to you, it's much more flexible side to side than the chairs you mentioned. It could be good for this reason, and it's a good fit for tall people.

That being said, I'd avoid the adjustable lumbar to reduce any unwanted pressure. Their return policy is good, so it can't hurt to try."
,"I would recommend the HW Zody. That chair is good for taller folks too but it‚Äôs got individual lumbar support meaning you can make the left side protrude or the right side protrude. It can definitely handle your weight and height. 

The Fern is a good pick too. I have the Embody and it‚Äôs most like the Embody, for taller folks but you can‚Äôt really control the lumbar individually. It‚Äôs either you have lumbar or not."

In my region (EU) I see a lot of other brands, like Interstuhl, Kl√∂ber, Wilkhahn, Dauphin and Ahrend. Does anyone know if these brands are also good?"

Need new chair recommendations,"Hi there,

Recently my Staples Dexley chair's mesh seat started to rip so it's not really comfortable for me to sit in anymore. I've used that and the Hyken and both were extremely comfortable. The only problem I really had with them was how they would lean back a little in the locked position when I prefer that extra support for good posture.

I'm currently 5'9 and weigh about 200 pounds. I think my must haves would be a headrest and that posture support I had mentioned earlier. I don't really have a set budget but anything around $1000 would preferably be my max, the less I can spend the better tbh. This is mostly because I recently started a job where I work from home 4 days a week and I spend a lot of time on my computer playing games, watching movies/shows, etc.

I've been looking at the Autonomous Ergochair Pro and the Mavix M9. The M9 seems a bit too expensive to justify plus I've seen it lacks that posture support. I've also heard a lot of bad reputation when it comes to the Ergochair as well? I've also been thinking about buying another Dexley but I'm not sure yet.  Any suggestions?"
,"Autonomous chair is crap, lots of investment dollars into their marketing. It‚Äôs overpriced $100-$200 chairs.

Mavix is a no name brand that is fairly new.

Is there a specific type of caster that is better than rollerblade style for carpets?,"My floor is laminate wood, but I have an area rug under my work desk for aesthetic / better on bare feet. I do not want to cover it with a mat. The rug is not super low cut but it is not very high either.

Currently I have the rollerblade style casters on my office chair, and it can be a pain to move the chair sometimes. Wondering if there is a specific style of casters that are better for carpets. 

Thank you for any help."
,I had that issue too. Solved it by getting a glass floor mat.
,By rollerblade style you mean the ones with replaceable wheels right? Maybe replacing your current wheels with harder ones might do the trick?
Steelcase gesture padding and headrest,"Hi all I have been looking at the steelcase gesture, overall the chair looks excellent however I have heard a couple of people complaining of either the headrest pushing their head too far forward or the padding being too weak for long work sessions.

FYI I am 5'11 and 75kg

How much would it cost for shipping a Gesture across the country (USA),It's 78lb.
,Probably about $100
,"Cost of shipping a Gesture is equal to the cost of buying a new Gesture. 

I can guarantee you that you're not going to know how to pack it properly and UPS is just going to drop kick your package until your Gesture shows up at your doorstep in 6 different pieces.

I always tell people to not bother shipping office chairs because people really don't realize that you don't run to Home Depot and use a $3 box for an office chair and that disassembling a chair to fit in a box is no joke. It's one of the most physically demanding tasks outside childbirth. 

Finally, tape selection is critical. I've seen plenty of returned chairs and the tape jobs are horrendous. Duct tape, contrary to popular belief, is not appropriate for shipping. A good roll of shipping tape, strong enough to handle an 80 pound chair, is going to cost you $10-15. None of that garbage tape at Walmart is going to cut it."
,"Go online to the websites for UPS, FexEx, USPS, etc, or try [PirateShip.com](https://PirateShip.com).  Put in the weight, box dimensions, addresses, etc.  If I had to guess though, it may be over $100, due to the weight and dimensions."
,Guessing about 250$
,I was quoted $189 and that was from Cali to Iowa. That was using freight which was to be cheaper than UPS or FedEx. I ended up not doing it and just bought new one.
,"I bought a secret labs titan and shipped it back for refund. If I had gone with standard pricing from UPS/FedEx or whoever it would have cost $165ish. Through work it was $30 or $35. 

If you have to ship it using published rates, it might make more sense to sell it and rebuy. If you can ship through a discounted rate from work or a friend's work account, it's much more cost effective.

The titan box was extra thick cardboard and had plenty of padding to protect the chair. It was also disassembled which helped with box dimensions. If you ship a chair fully assembled, you'll run into different costs based on dimensional weight or something. It can increase a lot of it's oversized or too big for parcel shipping."
New Haworth Soji vs 10 year old Aeron?,"Aeron is 10+ years old been in storage so never used. Has all the functional adjustments.

,"I purchased both an aeron and a new Soji and I preferred the Soji with lumbar support. I found the Aeron quite uncomfortable but the Soji had just the right amount of support and cushion. The only thing I dislike on the Soji is the wool seat fabric. It‚Äôs really warm and scratchy so if you have an option, opt for a different seat fabric if you tend to be on the warm side. Haworth is great because of the return policy so you can always try the chair out and see how it fits you and if it doesn‚Äôt work out they offer easy returns"

Ideally want a seller that offers free return shipping since I've had bad luck so far and have needed to return the chairs I've tried. Open to office and gaming chairs; don't care what it's labelled, as long as it works.

First chair I tried was the Alera Elusion. All the ergonomic controls were great, especially the seat depth adjustment for that price point, but was butt was aching after just half an hour in the chair, and this did not go away after giving the seat cushion time to break-in.

Then I tried a refurbished Leap from Crandall. The chair was perfectly fine condition, but my shoulders and neck would ache everyday after using it for a while, and sometimes my lower back. The extra cushioning added to the seat made this a seat where I did not find my butt hurting or numb. Faithfully tried to acclimate myself to the chair over the course of the 30 day return period, but in the end had to return it.

Third chair I've tried is the Tango from CoreChair. The main issue I had with this chair was that my legs would hurt or fall alseep after sitting in the chair for a while. In any case, this was an interesting chair to try.

So, here I am at present, alternating between sitting on the floor, stealing a wooden chair from the kitchen table, and standing. Definitely having some pain in the lower back, and afraid it will become more permanent without a good office chair solution."

Recommend an alternative to Leap v1?,"I live in a pretty remote part of the UK and don't have the option to test chairs unfortunately. I've been using a steelcase leap v1 but after speaking to the place I bought it from they think it requires too much work to salvage.

Now that I've spent some time in it, my tailbone is really starting to hurt. I'm not sure if it's because I'm coming from an all mesh chair or if the foam is just worn out. 

I see that there is a place that offers to sell you a reupholstered seat and they offer to add some cushioning to it as well, but I'm not sure how much that would help. They ask you to send your old cushion back to them and you get a deposit back, so I'm guessing they are just recycling those cushions and reupholstering them, which is fine I guess, but I don't know how much it will help my comfort. I'm willing to bet they are active on here, but I have no idea what their username is. [This is the website.](https://www.crandalloffice.com/)

This is the only company I'm aware of that does this.

Need help finding a chair.,"I'm on my third or fourth Staples Westcliffe chair in 3 years and I'm tired of getting replacements. Besides that, it meets some of my needs, but fails at others. Here are some details:

* I'm 6'0 and \~230lbs with a naturally wide frame.
* The 31in back height, 22in seat width, and 19in seat depth are pretty much perfect for me. Though, I'd like a taller back because this one ends where the base of my skull begins.
* I don't mind the leather, but it tears too easily.
* I often sit with one leg on the seat and under my other leg, often leaning to the side, and this chair feels great for that.
* My computer/workshop room has soft carpet.
* The arms are too low off the ground. I need a chair with arms that go up to at least 31in off the ground to use my piano.
* Since I study and work from home and most of my hobbies are seated (drawing, piano, writing, reading), I often spend 12+ hours on my chair over the course of the day. So I'd like good back/posture support and a strong gas cylinder (or whatever else) that can handle that. The ones on my Westcliffes wear out after a few months.

If ya'll need any more details feel free to ask. Thanks."
,"How much are you looking to spend?

I'm a little taller and heavier than you so I have problems with most seats. I went and tried every Herman Miller they had in my local showroom and found major issues with every one personally. I then went to a Steelcase dealer and honestly liked those even less.

I'm sure I'll get flamed for this here, but the best chair I've ever used is a Serta Jennings from Office Depot.

,"The Contessa is generally a good chair but at least one tier below the likes Steelcase, Herman Miller, Haworth, etc. in terms of build quality. It's more likely to creak and the adjustments are more likely to be sticky or otherwise finicky to use. I'd say if you can go test it in person to confirm it's clean and moves/adjusts smoothly, CAD$225 is a fair price. For Canada it might actually be a good price..."

Interesting (and super easy) hack for universal headrests?,"Most common complaint about aftermarket headrests for chairs that don't have a factory headrest seems to be lack of depth adjustment i.e. it pushes the head too far forward.

This guy in Amazon reviews section found an interesting solution where he attaches two pairs of fasteners to each other in order to mount the headrest with more depth.

Anyone tried this?"
,"nice. i find almost all headrests are pitched too far forward. like who thought that was a good idea and why do they keep doing that?

i got a hyken and i might give this a try. just got to find some reasonably sized u-brackets and an extra pair of bolts and nuts and this should be pretty easy.

good find and thanks for sharing."
Haworth Zody hitting backrest frame with shoulders,"I've recently bought a Haworth Zody and I can feel the frame of the backrest with my shoulder blades. It doesn't cause pain but I can just feel a hard plastic frame hitting my shoulder blades, especially when reclining when i relax in the chair. It's my first ever ergonomic chair so I don't have a lot of experience with them. My question is, is it normal to feel the frame of a chair with a mesh backrest or am I just to big (6'2""/187cm) for this chair? I'm still in my return period so that's why I'm doubting if is should keep it or look for another chair with a higher backrest. I hoop someone with more experience about chairs can help me out."
,Return and get something else
,"You shouldn't feel the frame at all. Unfortunately your torso is too tall for the Zody. Thank goodness for free returns!

You'd be better served by the Fern. For reference, the base Fern's lumbar support is about equal to the Zody's at its weak to medium tension, while the Fern's optional additional lumbar support bubble provides stronger lumbar support than the Zody at its strongest tension."
,"I'm 6'0 and just sat in the Zody in my room and I do ""feel"" the frame in my back when reclining but it doesn't bother me. 

The frame on the Zody is supremely flexible, just try reclining and rotating in the chair. The frame easily flexes. 

The frame is also contoured around your back and almost cradles your back. 

What I'm saying is I don't think it's really a big issue, in my limited experience with the Zody. Sure the frame is there but it's also flexible and contoured in a way to hug your back rather than poke at your back like, say, the rounded rod or whatever that thing is on the top of the Fern backrest. 

Finally, there's nothing wrong with a properly shaped piece of plastic pressing on your back. See: Herman Miller Mirra. I use a bare plastic Herman Miller Mirra backrest in my car as back support while driving--0 issues with plastic pressed up on my entire back. In fact adding the plastic backrest has alleviated my pain when driving."
Is it better to buy Gesture with headrest already on?,I'm thinking of buying a Gesture without a headrest. Is it possible to buy a headrest later and install it?
,"If you want the headrest, your only option is to buy it with it on. There is not a way to install it after the fact as the top of the chair is different depending on if you get the headrest or not"
,"If you want one,  you have to buy it with headrest right away. You can't install it later.

BTW: The headrest is totally overrated imo."
,I love the headrest and is the only chair that has worked for me. I would suggest buy it with and do no use it can adjust it out of the way.

Big & Tall Recommendations,"Hi all - I've done some searching through the sub and a lot of the existing recommendations aren't applicable (no longer in production, not tall enough). I need a chair with a seat height of at least 23"". I'm 6'5, and about 240 pounds. I find most chairs fall apart way too quickly. I live in Canada, and am hoping to keep this under about $500 pre-tax. Does anyone have any recommendations? I'd love to buy an Aeron Size C but it's just not doable, unfortunately."

I bought a used Steelcase Amia today- has some damage- any suggestions on how to repair?,"https://www.discountofficefurnitureinc.com/

Been looking for a good deal on a used office chair for a while- Found a big used office furniture warehouse in Springfield, MA so it was a bit of a hike for me (live on the MA/RI northern border). They have a ton of stock at reasonable prices- they were listing their used Amias for $300 but when I pointed out the damage he offered it to me for $150 so it was too good to pass up.  

I can tell already it's the best chair I've ever owned- but as you can see from the pic it has some slight damage on the back, it looks like someone with a heavy toolbelt sat in it, the threads are starting to come apart a bit on those marks. Also, the seat is heavily stained (difficult for me to notice in the store because the cushion is dark). I already sprayed the chair with dish soap and water. 

Functionally the chair works perfectly, so even if I can't clean it up it's still well worth the money. 

They have so much stock I just noticed on their website they have some Leaps in stock as well. Oh well, I'm happy with my purchase so far- beats an $80 Amazon gaming chair any day of the week."
,Upholstery extraction vacuum works decent. Reupholstery is another option.
,"I would try and find out how much the parts will cost and try to refurbish it yourself. Contact SC directly and send them a photo and see if they can help you locate the part. Also, if there‚Äôs a stain you‚Äôll need a upholstery cleaner to clean the chair. Good luck!"
,well that wasn't a good deal lol.
Big boi with shoulder pain looking to break up with horrible gaming chair,"Coming off an old Dxracer chair that was definitely one of the worse purchasing decisions in my life. I've been experiencing some shoulder pain recently from what appears to be subconsciously held shoulder tension due to difficulties reaching my kbm as a result of not being able to scoot deep enough into my deck to reach my devices properly. I'm very new to the idea of a proper chair but have recently switched to a split ergo keyboard so I may be interpreting the source of my discomfort improperly, but imagine the chair isn't helping. At the very least, the gas piston is in the early stages of giving up the grave so it's about time for a replacement any way.

6'2"" 260lb primarily playing video games, but lots of remote IT work thru the day as well (seeing 10h at in the chair on average but not in one 'sitting'; desk top is at a height of 28.25"", seat height settles at 21"" full height. Perhaps there's a discrepancy between those distances causing my arms to settle at weird positions especially considering my keyboard is tented rather dramatically?

Preferred budget is sub-$500 but willing to stretch up to $1k if the benefit is considerable given I did provide the new HM Vantum at least a few thoughts. Feel free to give any posture/desk/seating adjustment criticisms as well. I'm constantly worried I'm not sitting correctly but have no one but my own echo chamber to confirm."

Review of my Fern,"I've been using my [custom Fern](https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeChairs/comments/xikog5/my_custom_fern_arrived/) that I ordered from Modern Planet for about 3 weeks now. 

**PROS:**

* **Looks** - It looks awesome. It really does.
* **Comfort** - It blows my previous cheap Amazon chair out of the water. I can sit in it all day and have zero discomfort. 
* **Lumbar** - For me, when it's in the correct position (see CONS), it's great. Reviews online said the support was very aggressive, which I had concerns about. But I don't find it aggressive at all. It's very soft and very adjustable, when it stays put (see CONS).

**CONS**

* **Material** - This really maybe isn't a con, but more of a suggestion. Do not opt for a light color if you go custom. I went with the Beach color, which is a light tan, in the mesh material, and the headrest stains very easily. I'm not a greasy person at all. In fact I have very dry skin. But there is a spot developing where my head sits on the head rest. I've cleaned it and sprayed some Scotchquard on it, which helps for a bit. It at least allows me to wipe off the stain a little easier now. 
* **4D arms** -  After these have broken it a bit, holy crap these things are noisy. It's the only part of the chair that makes noise when you move. And the sliding part of them, forward and back, are way to loose. They move every time I get in and out of the chair. [I added a couple of very thin shims](https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeChairs/comments/xmvdac/tighten_the_4d_arms_for_haworth_fern/), which tightened them up. But you should not have to do that to a 1k chair. 
* **Lumbar** -  The support is great for every day use. My only problem is that I like to recline when I play games and I like the support higher up. It won't stay in that position when I lean back. Just the force of my back makes it slide back down to the nook of my spine. 
* **CS?** - I have contacted Haworth support about the Lumbar issue and easy to slide arms, and they said I need to go through Modern Planet. I get that, but Haworth literally made the chair and drop shipped directly to me. What will Modern Planet be able to do? So much for this awesome CS I keep hearing about. 

Over all, I have a little buyers remorse. For 1k, I expected the chair to look and perform flawlessly. But IMO, it just feels like a premium Amazon chair that you would get for $300-$400."
,"Customer service is always through the dealer you purchased from, not through the manufacturer (unless you bought directly from the manufacturer)."
,"I agree with most of your sentiment, though I think it definitely is a lot better than a $300 to $400 Amazon chair, I don't think that's a fair expectation/comparison at all. 

Though I am coming from a fully loaded Fern that doesn't have color issues or sound issues like yours did, and I paid under 1k USD."
,"Haworth really needs to get the Fern into more showrooms, with and without the optional lumbar support. How they expect anyone to know how strong a chair's lumbar support is without testing it, let alone the level of lumbar support you need, is beyond me. If you're gonna buy an expensive ergonomic chair online, it's much safer to get one with tension-adjustable lumbar support like the Zody or Very.

I have a [2016 Fern](https://i.imgur.com/zYSmY9Y.jpg) without additional lumbar that's held up perfectly so far, besides a few scrapes on the polished metal base. The seat is even comfier than when I first got it. Interestingly, it developed a slight creak while tilting for about 1.5 years, but that creak has recently disappeared. And yes, the armrests are  noisy when I adjust them; however, they stay in place and do not adjust too easily, unlike OP's unit.

Edit: added photo link"
,"Fyi, you can tighten the resistance on the 4D armcaps by unscrewing the top pad and exposing the system underneath. It's very easy, and if you just stick shims in there the issue will likely get worse with the excess strain.

I'm a little bit curious by your statement of comparing it to a 300-400 chair from Amazon. I'm not sure which chair you're getting at that price that competes with the Fern in terms of comfort, build quality, and support. Not that there aren't decent chairs at that price.

If you aren't happy with it you should absolutely seek for what suits you best. But imo, long term comfort is the most important factor by far. If you feel that you can get the same comfort and all your other needs elsewhere, for less, then seek it out. But I hope your expectations are within reason. I can't name a single chair on the market without downsides, regardless of cost or brand."
,"I had the Fern for a while. 

It was a nice chair certainly, but I found the seat pan too uncomfortable to keep, and the arm-wrests were relatively useless as my arms just slid right off because they are angled downward.

I also learned I don't think I like water-fall edge seating, it makes the seat feel shorter than it should = less support. 

Buying a Fern used, it's a good price, but considering Haworth (at least in Canada) recently doubled the price of the chair, it's directly competing with chairs with an extra step of refinement."
,">it just feels like a premium Amazon chair that you would get for $300-$400.

I think you're frames of reference are off. Amazon chairs in that price range aren't going to be good. Then on the top end I think you have to realize there is no ""perfect"" chair and even the best chairs aren't some sort of life altering experience."
,"In terms of the lumbar issue I was experiencing the same thing with my Fern and actually ended up stuffing it with a pillow to keep it in place and more aggressive. I had the same thoughts though, 1k and I‚Äôm still having to alter things? I unfortunately returned mine"
,"OP, I had issues with position of lumbar as well.

I ended up removing it for a bit, then eventually adding it back in but without the front zip tied.

Without the zip tie it seems happy to sit higher and is quite comfortable. I have no idea why they ziptie the front down."
,"It's nowhere near HM level of a chair. To me honestly its a little mindblowing that so many youtube channels pretend like it is. Its a good 500$ chair, but not a premium 1k+ chair that will carry you over 10 years."
,"I don‚Äôt know which Amazon chair competes with the Fern except for the Fern because Amazon sellers do sell the Fern in ever combo there is except for digital knit. I have always thought the Fern was the competitor of the HM Embody. They look like cousins with their backrests. If you‚Äôre still within the return period and you don‚Äôt like the chair then return it. It‚Äôs pretty simple, pal. Perhaps give the HM Embody a try. It doesn‚Äôt have 4D arms and it costs more but it‚Äôs a better chair imo."

,"Found this Haworth Fern listed for $40 approx 10 min from my house later at night. I immediately rushed and scooped it up, but realized the seat was jammed in the lowest position and the chair didn't swivel at all. It was a 2018 model though so I figured I'd contact Price Modern, a Haworth auth dealer.

I had heard great things about Haworth customer service and they came through! They scheduled a pickup and free repair with drop off, which took a little under 2 weeks! I don't know of Steelcase or Herman Miller doing such a thing for their chairs without asking for proof of purchase. My advice to you all is, if your Haworth chair you are interested in buying is within their 12 yr warranty, they will stand by it!

Tldr; Haworth customer service for secondhand chair purchases is amazing!"

Office chair tips even when locked,"Hi all,

I've got a question about general functionality. I want to achieve the straight back ideal that most ergonomic advice suggests, but my current office chair, even when locked, tips back about 15-20 degrees. I can sit up without the support of the back of the chair, but what's the point if you can't lean back on it for said support now and then?

As I said, The lock is on, so it stops it tipping back at a certain point, but what I don't understand is why there is any give at all. Is this a normal thing? Am I missing something?"
,Sitting up straight is an outdated concept of healthy posture that does not work for the length of time we spend sitting at our computers today. It is more ergonomic to sit in a slight recline because this diverts some weight from your spinal column and tailbone to the backrest. This is why most ergonomic chairs have you sit in a slight recline even at their most upright tilt locked position.
,"Trust us, we know that 30% of the time it is used for jerking off"
,I did check with customer care and this chair is rated for sitting all day 13 hours+. It‚Äôs for upright ergonomic seating. Anyway I‚Äôve ordered one to see how it feels. They have a decent return policy so no harm in trying.

I typically spend 400+ for a mid range office chair but after trying about 50 different chairs at Staples, it was the only one I could even stand.  I needed a chair ASAP and figured for the price I'd just use it for a couple weeks while I found a more premium chair I liked and then just donate it to one of my nephews.

It's by no means premium, but it fits my body perfectly ( 6'1"". 210lbs).  It still looks like the day I bought it and I'm reminded how much I like it on a daily basis.  There was a higher priced model called Vartan but it was not at all comfortable.

Offeco offers in Europe,"Hi there! Is there anybody who used this website [https://offeco.nl/refurbished/](https://offeco.nl/refurbished/) in Europe?

They have really good offers for the refurbished **Steelcase** and **HM** chairs, but I'm not sure if they have the same quality as the original ones

wdyt guys?"
,"2 weeks ago I ordered from their website a refurbished Steelcase Leap V2 (black) for 640 euro.

They shipped it within 5 days (Netherlands). You will receive the chair in a box, you still have to put the upperpart of the seat on the base of chair. The chair comes with new wheels wich you have to click on the base and comes with a new gas spring, dont forget to remove the plastic cover on top of the gas spring.

I saw on the sticker on the bottom of the seat that my chair was manufactured in 2006 in France, so the chairs they refurb are pritty old imo. At least the chair sits really good, all adjustments work like intended, no noise or rattling sounds and the black fabric seems totally new, which makes the chair look as new. My chair has some scratches on the tensionnop but you have to really look closely to see it.

It's a lot of money for a chair but I gues it's worth it because almost nobody offers it second hand on FB or Marktplaats in The Netherlands at least. A new Leap will cost you 1200+ euro wich is really a lot of money, the only advantage is the warrenty. On the one from Offeco you get 1 year warranty and the first 90 days you are able to return it and get your money back.

I hope this helps you."

Guitarist / short fella - chair recs,"Hey all,

Looking for some recommendations for a good office chair suitable for a short (5‚Äô6/175lbs) guitar player. High adjustable / removable arms are a must and preferably something with a big enough seat to sit cross legged in. I use a standing desk, so the HAG Capisco has been high on the list. However, I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs (by design) not the most comfortable. I‚Äôve also been considering the Steelcase Amia.

help me choose a chair,"I'm ready to invest in a nice chair and I'm having a really hard time figuring out what to buy (and yes, I've been searching and reading here for a while!)
Info:
- I'd like to keep to a budget of about $500, but could potentially double that for the perfect chair. 
- I'm only 5'1"" tall, and very slightly built. Most chairs are waaay too big for me. 
- adjustable depth is absolutely crucial for me, without it even the smaller chairs are too deep
- I have a strong preference for fully mesh, with firm seats. I do not like most of the padded seats I've tried. 
- I do not like the Aeron. I've tried it, the size A is a good fit for my body, and based on the specs it sounds like it should be perfect for me. But the front of the frame digs into the back of my knees and I just don't like that chair.
- the only chair I've tried so far that felt perfect when I sat on it in store was the x2 from x-chair, but I hesitate to buy it because I've repeatedly read (here and elsewhere) that is not actually that good of a chair and not worth the money
- If at all possible I want to avoid having to buy/try/return a bunch of different options. I'm very willing to drive around to different retailers to try in person before buying, but I know myself and my executive dysfunction well enough to know that once I buy a chair I'll probably never get around to returning even if it really isn't right for me. 

Please help me figure out what to buy!"

Any way to tell if this is an authentic Steelcase Gesture?,"There‚Äôs a Gesture for sale by a private seller in a local Marketplace listing. Is there a way to tell if it‚Äôs genuine and actually the one listed in the tag (or if it‚Äôs stolen, I suppose)? Seems like these tags could easily be swapped to other chairs.

The price is awfully good for what looks like a good condition chair, especially for the aparent ship date of 2021. I suppose it could entirely be a scam, as I notice the protective paper is still on the legs and the tag is still on it.

Steelcase Gesture side to side cylinder wobble,"For anyone that has the Gesture can you tell me if the entire seat above the cylinder wobbles/tilts to one side or the other? Went to a showroom and every single Gesture would slant to the right or left side by like 5, maybe even 10 degrees if you shifted your weight. It was like the seat wasn't even properly fit onto the cylinder. This is usually normal due to lots of wear and tear with pneumatic cylinders but I was shown some brand new chairs and they all wobbled. Showperson also said this wouldnt be covered by warranty as every chair has it? what?"
,"I sit in a Gesture every day and mine does this as well (as do many office chairs), and is definitely normal. We've worked on a ton of these chairs and they are very well built and have never seen any sort of failure associated with this wobble/tilt. If it bothers you, keep looking at chairs, but if it doesn't (I honestly never even noticed it until I read this and went back and forth and felt it - it definitely doesn't feel un-natural or like it's going to fall), it's definitely not a point of concern from a built quality or product failure standpoint.

This is normal? Lumbar support Haworth Zody,"Hey!

Ive just bought a full spec second hand Haworth Zody. However, there is something that worries me.

When I adjust the lumbar support at certain height, If I start reclining the chair, the lumbar support doesnt maintain its position and starts to slip down. For example if I adjust the lumbar support at the top position, after reclining several times I find the support at a mid position.

I understand that this shouldnt happen right? Any suggestion?

(UK) I'm going insane trying to find a chair that suits my needs but I don't have much money. Help!,"I've basically become chair obsessed lately trying to find an inexpensive but good and comfortable chair for long hours of usage. I just got a Secret Lab Titan 2020 a couple weeks back but absolutely hate it. The seat is like concrete and the back just doesn't feel like it properly supports me at all. I do really like the recline and tilt feature but overall sitting in this thing for an hour causes me all sorts of pains. 

SO. I've been looking into other office chairs/ergonomic chairs but I cannot seem to find something that isn't ¬£1000 that's actually good. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: I \*\*cannot\*\* do second hand/liquidation chairs because I can't find a good site with trustworthy return policies. Plus, I have severe OCD so I like to get stuff brand new so I know that it's packaged up and hasn't had someone breathing all over it and touching it. 

Everything I've looked at, Ikea chairs, chairs on amazon like Sihoo or Tecova (the chinese stuff) seems to be poor quality but still expensive. I feel like I'm going insane just trying to find a CHAIR. I've looked at the IKEA Markus and Jarfvallet but both seem to have pretty major issues like the arm rest being bad and the lumbar support being not great. Other than that... I can't seem to find anything. 

If anyone UK based could point me towards something that's decent quality and won't fuck my back/butt up, I'd really really appreciate it!"

Leap v2 sinking?,Just picked up a Leap v2 and it sinks a couple inches when initially sitting in it? Haven‚Äôt noticed any more sinking while I‚Äôm already seated. Is this normal?
,Used or new?
"Does the Leap's backrest lag by design, or is lag a defect?","I like the Steelcase Leap V2 (I like the Gesture better, but that price!). I want to get one used... but oh that backrest lag, I can't stand it.^‚Ä† So I went into this decision assuming Leap wasn't an option. Until I sat in a new one...

**There was no backrest lag at all** in the new Leap v2 I sat in at a dealer. After looking around here, some Leap owners report lag and some don't, and it doesn't seem to be associated with new vs old. Even the BTODtv review mentions the lag as a feature of the chair. It's clearly not, or if it was Steelcase has since tweaked the design.

Does anyone know what's going on? 

* If I get a used one that lags can I fix it with lubricant, or warranty?

* If I get one (used or new) that doesn't lag, will it eventually lag?

This issue is so strange in it being so variable, so widespread, and the behavior being so impactful to the performance of the chair. For Steelcase to not definitively address it is odd.

‚Ä† *Backrest lag is, while reclined, the seat back remaining momentarily in the reclined position trailing your back as you sit up straight, allowing separation from the back. The new chair I sat in last week didn't do this at all. Others have reported getting new chairs that did do this. Here are a few links referencing this issue*:

* [Another minor mention of this behavior in the BTODtv 3-year review](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxzZQ4phSI9vWxEJIV4P9qn8aNR0zj3c67), around 3:42"
,"The backrest lag as you're describing, is actually an issue with the seat.

The recline mechanism of the Leap is a bit different from many others, rather than a typical synchro tilt recline where the seat tilts back, instead the seat is on a set of ""rails"" or ""tracks"" and moves as you recline. As you lean back, the seat slides forward on these rails, and as you lean forward the seat slides back on these rails. This opens up your pelvic area a lot, and was an ergonomic goal with the leap. 

That being said, the lag has pros and cons. If you're someone who likes to rock back and forth, and move around a lot in the chair then the Leap isn't for you. But if you want to generally remain in a leaned back position with little effort, and prefer a somewhat stationary method of sitting without rocking back and forth, this lag is actually beneficial as you can do that with less effort than with most chairs.

But yes, lubricating the chair will help with this on a used one. Adding white lithium grease to the rails and some other spots will make this function less ""laggy"" as demonstrated here https://youtu.be/v9jKXncsNj4

You can actually see the sliding of the seat in the video you posted in your comment. That's where the lag or sticky feeling comes from. And yes it may eventually need to be relubricated even if you buy new, it really depends on how much you want or don't want the lag. It's not a bug, or a feature, but it is part of the design."

Fixed persistent creak on a Steelcase gesture that remained after lubricating every hinge in the chair.,"I completely disassembled my Steelcase gesture in search of the source of a creak. After exposing and lubricating every hinge the creak remained. The only remaining possibility was that the height-adjust cylinder was creaking.  I removed the cylinder from the bottom of the chair, cleaned all of the existing grease from the contact surface with a paper towel, and lightly sanded (with fine sandpaper) the contact surfaces to remove additional stuck debris. I then relubricated the contact surfaces with a dry lube and reinstalled the cylinder into the base. The creak seems to have gone away.

A tip for removing the cylinder: I rested the seat on my lap and pushed it down using a 3/4"" socket and a hammer. 
 
Warning: sanding too much or removing the factory lubrication could damage the chair in the long run as the contact surface is less protected.

This fix is probably possible without complete disassembly if you can remove the cylinder from the bottom without accessing the top. I disassembled it to find the sound.

,"They're all very expensive, so unless you have a very high income and money is no issue for you, I think it's worth getting in the habit of checking facebook marketplace and similar local sites on a daily basis. I bet you would find some great deals out there too, judging by the fact that even I was able to, and I live in Hungary where these chairs aren't common either. I bought a used Steelcase Please v2 for like ~$25 and it's in good condition, no stains, no tears, no wears, fully functional. The only part that's a bit sketchy is the seat cushioning which possibly lost some of it's softness over the years, but I honestly can't tell if that's the case since these v2 variants are manufactured with thinner padding by default. 
So yeah, if you do your search diligently, I think you might be able to find some good offers of Steelcase, HM or Haworth chairs over a couple of weeks. 
If you wanna be efficient, just bookmark your searches, or even set one as your homepage and you're good to go. But don't just search them by their name because the best deals are always titled simply ""Office chair""."

However, to answer your question, can‚Äôt you just replace the gas lift mechanism on your current chair? I just recently replaced one of my chairs with a longer gas lift mechanism. Dismantling isn‚Äôt as hard with the availability of videos on YouTube. You‚Äôd basically need a mallet, a pipe wrench, lubricant (WD-40)and lots of elbow grease.

Much cheaper alternative than purchasing a new chair outright.

Budget is $1k\~ but prefer to spend less if I can. Fortunately I have nice corporate discounts at HM (35%), Steelcase (40-50%), and some decent discounts at others (Humanscale, Knoll). Not against buying from Crandall either and I would def. avoid local just to ensure my money is well spent w/ warrantied product.

I've looked closely at the Embody, Fern (No discount so prob out), Leap V2, Gesture. Open to any suggestions from the community. Thanks in advance!"
,"Are you trying to improve your posture or accommodate a bunch of weird postures? Either way, the Gesture with 40-50% off sounds like the move to me for its high quality and extra-adjustable armrests. If you wanna get really crazy, you can sit in even more unusual postures in a Knoll Generation or Regeneration (with the backrest to the side or front of your torso), but those chairs won't be as comfortable for healthy neutral posture given your tall build and their mid-backs."
,Very much looking forward to seeing this. I'm looking to replace a 20+ year old Aeron and have more or less settled on an Embody. But maybe this will change my mind (though I'm not a huge fan of the gamer aesthetic).

Should have been lockable either down or fully up regarding tilt.

Have to see what first adopters think.  Not real sure I like the idea of a simple narrow stick as my spine support."

HM High Back Sayl vs used HM Aeron?,"Male, 182 cm, 81 kg (6'0"", 178 Ibs)

Hello guys! I'm looking to upgrade my current chair with an high level seat, and I was looking into these two Herman Miller chairs. For context, I'm an athletic person who spends 6+ hours a day sitting in front of my computer because of my job.
I also have lower back problems that I'm trying to resolve with a good posture and lots of stretching.

I heard that the Sayl it's not ideal for tall people, but my local reseller offers the opportunity to buy it with an upholstered high back, height adjustable arms and adjustable lumbar support at the price of 750‚Ç¨.

Arm Pad replacement for Staples Westcliffe,"I've seen a few other posts in this sub looking for similar things.   


I have a Westcliffe from staples and the arm pads are suuuuper worn out. I work from home and then also game at the same computer so I sit in this chair for 10+ hours a day. The only problem when trying to look up replacements online is that most chairs have the standard 4"" mounting holes. These pads have 8 1/4"" spacing between them. Lines up a little closer to 21 cm than 8 1/4 in to be honest. Can't find any other pads that are this larger size. Is this just some weird proprietary bullshit that Staples does or do these parts actually exist somewhere?"
Replacement arms for Steelcase Think v2?,"I recently bought a Steelcase Think v2 on fb market place for a pretty good deal. The seller told me that they were the 4d arm version, but after driving an hour and a half to pick up the chair, I realized they only move up and down. Since it was still a good deal and I'd driven an hour, I went ahead and bought it anyway. Even without the 4d arms, the chair is still an upgrade, but is there any place I can buy the 4d arms as a replacement? I've poked around Amazon, Crandall office parts, Steelcase, and Ebay but I can only find replacement pads, not the whole arm."

Steelcase amia hurts the sides of my butt thinking about an Embody,I'm 5'6 and I bought a 250$ amia to upgrade from the omega secret labs chair I had. I have a few issues with the chair though and I'm not sure if its years of bad posture getting fixed or if this chair is just not for me. I've had it for 2 weeks and it hurts my butt unlike my omega. and I don't want to have to add a seat cushion to it as that defeats the purpose. I also noticed that the lack of head support is kind of annoying but I'm not sure if I'm just not used to it yet or what. Do you guys recommend just going all out and getting an embody or is the seat worse on that?

Any good mesh chair for short person,"Hi all,

I am 5'5"", and recently bought used Steelcase Amia in pretty good shape for $150, because many ppl said it is comfy for short person. It was okay but my major complaint is that it gets quite hot and stuffy, which could lead to skin breakout due to my Eczema. It really did remind me why I always got mesh chairs before (most recent one I used was WorkPro something from officedepot).

So I am now kind of looking for another ergonomic mesh office chair (full or at least back). I am currently considering Steelcase Series 1, as its price is quite reasonable even for the new ones after the discount. But it would be great to get some recommendations from you guys.

My preferences:  
1. Minimum height not too tall, minimum seat depth not too deep: I am a short person.  
2. Lumbar support: I really appreciated lumbar support  
3. Front and back armrest adjustment: I like it pushed all the way back  


Thanks!

PS: I can't afford any Herman Miller (even used), because, in my area, ppl are selling used ones over 10-yrs old for more than $400. Not buying that shit."
,"The [Friant Ignite](https://www.friant.com/seating/lgnite/) seems like a great fit for you. Well-built for the price, strong but not overwhelming height-adjustable lumbar support, and nice adjustable armrests that move forward & backward.

steelcase advice,"Hi,

I am desperate need for a new chair ad need some opinions/advice.

I started with a IKEA MARKUS 8-10 years ago which was on its last legs at the end of last year.

I got a chair provided from work which was good to begin with but soon fell apart due to be cheaply made.

Forgot to mention I tried a NOBLECHAIRS HERO but had to return it after 5 days due to tingly pins and needles feelings in my lower legs after sitting in the chair for a few hours.

I was forced to switch back to MARKUS 2 weeks ago and can feel that my lower back is starting to struggle. I have decided to go refurbished as that is all my budget will allow and have 2 options available due to available stock.

Steelcase Leap V2 with headrest

or

Steelcase Gesture no headrest

I am leaning towards the Leap due the better seat and the Headrest as I like to be able to lean back in the evenings while watching something on my PC. only down to this Leap it comes with the 2D not 4D arms,

Gesture comes with the 4D arms but no Headrest but looks like the better chair overall as the backrest looks better.

I have only been able to watch videos and read materials online to make these conclusions which is why I'm asking for opinions here from those who have first hand experience. my budget is $550-$750 USD.

Thanks in advance"
,"I tried both for a short while in a showroom. I'm 170cm tall. 

Leap V2 Headrest has a very forward position. It pushed my neck forward into discomfort. I find it better without the headrest, it seems that can be removed later on. 

Leap backrest has a more hugging feeling than the gesture. The back on the gesture is a bit stiffer. Arm rests on the gesture is much nicer, so for me I would choose the gesture."
,"I used a Markus for 7 years before switching this year. Tried a new Gesture with headrest for a month and then found a very good used Leap v2 with 4D arms without headrest, so kinda the opposite of what you are considering. But my 2 cents on them both.

Love the Gesture. Seat cushion could be a little more comfortable for long days, but I regularly sit in it for 10+ hours a day and it's not bad by any means and far better than my old Markus. Love the 4D arms, very customizable and unique swing in/out.  

Leap seat cushion is a little better, but not vastly. Mine is 4D arms but if they were just 2D I would not like it as much. Being able to angle them in (or in the Gesture's case, swing them in) is really helpful for me.

I'm returning the Gesture and keeping the Leap. While I liked the Gesture better, think it's the nicer chair some respects, and prefer a headrest, the $1k+ price difference ($250 vs $1,300) was enough that I'll just try an add-on headrest to the Leap if I decide I want the headrest later. If my Leap had 2D arms though, that would have been enough to swing me back to keeping the Gesture or continue looking.

I'd say it really depends on how much you want the headrest after coming from the Markus for that long, since that will be the biggest change from my experience. I don't have any experience with the Leap's headrest but I think that's usually what people like least about it. While 2D arms is still better than the unadjustable Markus ones so would still be an improvement, I would chose the Gesture without headrest personally. I like the 4D arms that much. Hope something of this helps!"
Ergonomic office chair to help relieve repetitive stress injury in shoulder/neck area?,"Hi guys! I am looking for an ergonomic office chair that is highly adjustable, comfortable to sit in for 8+ hours, and most importantly has a high back so that it can support my upper back. Over the past few months I have developed a repetitive stress injury near my right shoulder blade (just to the left of the bone and up a few inches). I am 100% sure it's due to the scrunching up of my shoulder since that's the hand I use to operate my mouse. Basically after I work for more than about 30 minutes I feel a sharp, tingling pain going through muscle and aggravating nerves in that area. It's so uncomfortable it has made me have to work from bed sometimes. 

I would love some honest reviews of chairs you've tried that specifically help to support the upper back/cervical spine and neck/shoulder area. I know most chairs are advertised to relieve lumbar pain, which isn't nearly as bad for me as the upper back pain. I would also love it if they came in colors other than black :)

FYI, I would love something like the Steelcase Gesture chair with the headrest, but that is way out of my budget. Something under $400 would be ideal. I am also open to buying used/refurbished chairs on eBay at a discount.

Thanks!"
,">I am 100% sure it's due to the scrunching up of my shoulder since that's the hand I use to operate my mouse.

You should be able to mouse with relaxed shoulder. Sounds like your desk is too high. If you can't adjust it lower, consider raising your seat and using a footrest, or perhaps installing a keyboard tray.

More affordable office chairs in particular are not one-size-fits-all, so what are your height and weight? Any particularly long legs or torso? This info is important for chair fit."
,"I've purchased every high end ergonomic chair on the market and the one I've liked the most is the Aeron Remastered. It really forces you to sit with a good posture and distributes your weight over the whole chair pretty well so there are no real pressure points. Best of all you don't have to worry about any material getting dirty, ripping, or any padding wearing out. Also what's great is that it comes in 3 sizes, where as all other chairs mostly come in 1 size, so it's very likely you will find one that fits you properly."

Think this is worth it?,It is a classic Aeron. Know these are pretty sought after but I like crossing my legs. Worth the 100 bucks and a 1 1/2 hour drive if this isn‚Äôt a scam? Looks okay but only one picture on the listing.
,"Hell yeah that‚Äôs worth it, you can always buy it for 100 and sell it for even more if you don‚Äôt like it"
,You‚Äôre asking if a $1700 chair for $100 is worth it?
,"Crossing your legs is virtually impossible in this chair. I have been testing a bunch of chairs, and while I see why people love the Aeron -- it is by far the most comfortable if you can sit upright with perfect posture full time -- it also feels very constricting. I would describe it as an extremely comfortable prison. As a fellow cross-legged sitter, I would recommend you pass (unless you can try one out at a dealer/retailer and you fall in love with it). At that price though I'm sure you would have no problem reselling it, probably for a profit if you are patient."

Full Loaded Steelcase Amia or Digital Knit Fern.,"Should I get an Amia through my company fully loaded for $400, or a Fern fully loaded with digital knit for $1330?  I had the leather Amia and I had to send it back as it didn't feel like the fabric ones in the office.  So both would be fabric. Is this extra $1k justified?  Has anyone tried both?  The leather Amia gave me back fatigue after an hour or 2."
,I would much rather have the Fern in digital knit over an Amia any day of the week. They are two completely different chairs but the Fern is a better chair. You should be comparing the Fern to a Gesture or Leap not an Amia.
,"I have an Amia and it's really comfy. BTODtv also reviewed the Amia and it was actually rated as high and sometimes higher than leap v2 [here](https://youtu.be/LichtcXPSHg).

I think the main concern with Amia is not enough lumbar but if you already tried and liked the amount of lumbar, it seems it should be fine for you.

Of course the fern digital knit looks pretty insane so I'd go for that is money isn't a concern lol. Just my 2 cents, Amia is more than enough in a chair, both for those 3 guys in the video who are pro chair reviewers, and for myself."

Leap V2 lumbar knob question,"I have a Leap V2 and I notice when I am spinning the lumbar knob adjuster, I don't see or feel any movement in the lumbar area.

Does the knob not working at all without the plastic piece?

1. [Merryfair WAU 2](https://merryfairstore.com/product/2/wau) \- Mesh one
2. [Bestuhl S15](https://bestuhl.co.kr/en/chair/s15/)

If anyone have any opinion in helping me getting either one of them. I am preferring comfort and build quality.These are the only options at this moment for me now."
,"Hi, thank you for checking out my post. 

I got this off Facebook Marketplace about a month ago, and it has been sinking with some regularity. The first solution suggested online is to adjust the set screw, but when I took the seat off I found this instead of a set screw. When the set lever is pressed, the nub in the middle moves right and you are able to adjust the height. 

Also, when taking off the seat I noticed this dust forming around the cylinder. Anyone know what could be causing that, and how I could fix it? My first guess would be that somehow the up and down from the sinking is wearing at the cylinder housing, which of course will cause it to sink more. Any suggestions?

Thank you"
,This is the newer side activated version with out set screw.  99 percent chance it's the cylinder.

,"Hey guys, this is my first time having an office chair and I was wondering, how does this work? I can't figure it out other than when I push up the lever thingy it goes up and while sitting down while still holding it, it goes down. I'm planning to tilt lock my chair but can't figure it out. Any help is much appreciated!"
,Lifting the lever controls the seat height. Pushing it in / pulling it out controls the tilt lock.

How to find your forever office chair?,"I'm new to both /r/OfficeChairs AND the idea of caring about office chairs (I'm used to buying whatever is ""good enough"") but I'm (finally) looking to get a properly nice office chair--hopefully my ""forever"" chair.  By this I mean a chair I will be happy with for as long as possible.  Cursory browsing seems to indicate this will be in the ballpark of $1500ish, does that sound right or am I off base?  


While I'm happy to discuss specific chairs, I'm more interested in taking a step back and asking how does one CHOOSE such a chair? I don't mind spending some time making sure I have the right chair, I just don't want to WASTE time doing so.  Where would you all go to compare chairs if you didn't know which one you want?  What would you look for (besides how it feels)?  How much can you figure out online vs what do you need to actually try in a chair?  If you all went to a store, what would you actually try to do in the chair?  


The only feature I KNOW I want, besides top notch build quality, is that I want a mesh back as I tend to run hot & air movement makes all the difference."
,"There are 3 brands to look at. Herman Miller, Steelcase, and Haworth. Those are the top 3 name brands. I have 2 HM chairs, the Logitech Embody and the gaming Sayl. There are many option under these 3 name brands you can choose from around $1500 and all manufacturers have a 12yr warranty with Haworth only warranting their fabric for 5yrs. If you want the best, there is the Embody, Aeron, Gesture, Leap, Fern, and Zody. The Aeron, Mirra 2, Cosm, and Setu are 100% mesh and the Fern can be partially mesh and same with the Zody but their seat pan is fabric. There are no Steelcase chairs that are mesh except for the Karman but that‚Äôs a brand new chair with no adjustments. 

You will need to do some research yourself. I don‚Äôt think you are suggesting someone else do the research for you and just give you ideas so if I were you I would look into all the chairs I‚Äôve mentioned. If you have a specific question please ask."

Looking for chair that is comfortable for sitting as well as lounging/reclining,"I've been WFH for at least 10 years now. I recently moved my office into a new room and went from two separate desks/chairs to a single L desk that has both my work PC and play PC. Outside of working 8 Hrs, my personal PC is used for gaming as well as media consumption (movies/tv/music).

I currently use a SecretLab Titan but seeing as I now sit in this chair for both work and play (whereas before it was just for play), I'm finding it less comfortable for these longer sessions.

As mentioned, I like to be able to roll the chair back a little and recline and use a foot rest when watching movies/tv or relaxing with music. Ideally I'd like a super comfortable chair for this, comfortable even for short naps, while also being supportive and not problematic with back or hip issues.

Does such a chair exist that is both great for long sitting sessions and also quite comfortable for reclining/lounging? Any and all suggestions are welcome and appreciated!"

Additional lower-mid back Pillow/Accessory Support for Aeron,"Additional lower back Pillow/Accessory Support for Aeron

&#x200B;

Hey,

Like the title says basically - I have been experiencing lower back pain, and need additional support, which was I was told by a professional.  A regular non-fluffy pillow was actually so thick that it pushed me off the seat of the chair.  

The Aeron with no tilt has you sitting with the slightest tilt, and I tend to want to sit straight up (without leaning over forward).

As for the lumbar insert that the Aeron has - it is far too aggressive and actually feels like it's poking too hard, so that it why I do not use it.

Can anyone recommend a good, but not too thick lower/mid back lumbar support item, or even a basic pillow that might help?

Leap or Gesture or something else for heavy guy who WHM and PC games?,"I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 285lbs but despite this I never really had problems with my office chairs until‚Ä¶I started working from home full time when Covid started 2yrs ago.  

It took a few months of WFH but eventually my butt started to hurt from sitting so much between 8hrs for work, and then 1-6hrs after work playing games in my PC (not non stop, I do get up and take breaks).  Mostly in the back of the ‚Äúcushions‚Äù near the tail bone but I wouldn‚Äôt say it was the tail bone exactly.

At the time I had a Maxnomic ‚Äúgaming‚Äù chair, the wide seat one.  I realize now it has little to no padding and is extremely stiff in the seat cushion, honestly don‚Äôt know how it didn‚Äôt bother me the couple of years before WFH/Covid, but I never had any problems with it till I started WFM 5 days a week.

I tried a different gaming chair, same issue (not much seat cushion), gave those up and tried a Staples brand mesh chair, still didn‚Äôt help.  I eventually bought a Purple seat cushion which has been a HUGE help but it doesn‚Äôt stay on the chair well and I grow tired of it moving around so much, it‚Äôs become very annoying.  So I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs finally time to spend some quality money on a good office chair, I spend so much on every other aspect of my PC gaming hobby I figure it‚Äôs time to spend it here now.

TL:DR - as a heavy person I‚Äôm looking for a good, comfortable seat chair that I can sit in for LONG periods at a time (between working from home all day and PC gaming all night) and not have my butt cheeks get fatigued."
,"I think either would probably be fine, but would probably lean towards the Gesture depending on how much width you need between the arms - the Leap has a few pressure points where the arms connect to the frame of the chair that are not present on the Gesture due to how the arms are attached.

,"For your build, I recommend the [Sitmatic Goodfit](https://www.officedepot.com/catalog/search.do?Ntt=Sitmatic+goodfit+mid-back+with+adjustable+arms) with standard seat and mid-back (both are larger than they sound). It's a sturdy chair with a 400-lb capacity that isn't overly large, with a seat that provides a fine balance of cushion and support. There are three mechanisms to choose from:

* The multifunction is designed to let you to fine-tune your backrest/seat position and stay there.

* The synchro is designed to let you rock the chair in a smooth motion, or lock the chair in one of a few positions.

* The enhanced synchro is the best of both worlds. It has all the functionality of the standard synchro mech, but also lets you fine-tune the backrest angle."

Headrest mod for Leap under ¬£100 in Europe?,"I've tried a few chairs and really liked the Leap v2. I'm looking to buy a refurbished one for ¬£350, but the used and refurbished never have a headrest.

I like the leap cause its firm and makes me sit upright, but I need the headrest for example when I want to relax, fully recline and listen to music or just stay there for a bit to think.

I was looking for a headrest mod that doesn't cost really that much, I looked at the mod on this sub but it would cost me 200 here in UK.  I don't care about the headrest quality I just need something so I can relax my neck when I'm fully reclined.

Can someone explain the difference between these versions, please?"
,"I don't think there's an different between home/office edition... At least not in terms of how the chair functions. 

I've noticed the shell back has maybe slightly more flexibility, but it's pretty much the same other than aesthetic. 

The only real difference makers in customization are adjustable lumbar, headrest or no headrest, and different casters."
,"I *strongly* recommend you check with local dealers.  I'm in Canada (I know, different country) but I got mine for $1600 after-taxes CDN, whereas the website was going to be closer to $2400 CDN.

,"The only difference is the construction of the back to accommodate the wrapped back design. This is 90% visual, but in my opinion the wrap back does have a bit less give and movement on the upper back area, but it's not significant.

,"You can usually find good condition, used HermanMiller Aeron chairs for around that budget.

The tight mesh is great for all day use as no pressure hotspots buildup on body contact surfaces (ie butt), and they have good back and lumbar support support. The lumbar support is technically an add-on option, but almost every used chair is going to have it. They also come in different sizes A-C, so the fit will be good if you find the right size (sizing chart online). You can buy an aftermarket headrest online off Amazon (for example) to take it to the next level and upgrade in stages for maximum comfort when budget allows. One of my favorite aspects of the chair is that the seat can lean back quite far, so this plus headrest is incredible if you want to kick back for a few between sessions upright at the computer. 

You can also completely rebuild them via plentiful replacement parts available online, if desired, including the seat pan and back rest. This means you can get decades out of them without compromising support and comfort.

If you can't tell, I'm biased towards them, but there's a reason why they have been one of the top ergo office chairs for decades now."
,"The downside of a herman miller is they're not comfy they're ergonomic, I considered one off and on but couldn't get past that. You can try one out at John lewis in the uk btw ( take your time, the staff are used it lol). The upside of that chair is you can resell at same price pretty much."
,"Since you are in Europe, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to get an ACTIU Stay chair. 

That has been by far the best chair I have had. It is fully customizable (materials, colours etc).

I'm 6""3 (around 192cm) and I imported it to my country ( not in Europe) it took 90 days to import it from Spain to my country. The waiting time was worth it every penny. I guess for you it will be way faster.

Too much lumbar support?,"Hi there- I‚Äôm looking for some advice, as I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do about my WFH seating situation. I spend about 8 hours at my desk each day. I have a sit/stand, so I try to stand for at least an hour during a meeting or two. However, I‚Äôve been having major trouble finding a task chair that doesn‚Äôt absolutely kill my lower back. 

I ordered a factory return of the Steelcase Amia and I‚Äôm nearing the end of my 30 day trial. The problem is twofold: I was sick for about 10 days in the middle of my trial, so I haven‚Äôt been able to get the full 30 day test in. And, my lower back is killing me. Everything I read indicated that the Amia was ‚Äúlighter‚Äù on the lumbar support, but no matter how I adjust it, I‚Äôm in terrible pain by the end of the day. I really want to love this chair, but I don‚Äôt. 

I feel like I want a chair with zero lumbar support, but that seems to go against every expert‚Äôs recommendation. 

So, do I keep the Amia and cross my fingers that my body magically adjusts and I end up loving the chair? Or do I return it and go back to the drawing board? What would you recommend? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and about 165lbs for context.  Im half tempted to buy one for those chunky lazy boy executive chairs, but they‚Äôre soooo ugly!"
,"It's possible you want a chair with a natural curve and no adjustable lumbar. 

Haworth Fern (No adjustable lumbar version), Eurotech Vera, Haworth Zody (without lumbar again)... most likely something mesh will work for you.

The Leap v2's lumbar can be set to pretty weak, but might not be right for you still.

If you don't feel comfortable after 2+ weeks, don't force it. But I highly recommend you don't go for one of those chunky executive chairs. They are not ergonomic in many ways, and if you're working at a desk you will absolutely feel that. 

Lastly, have you made sure to adjust the amia to your settings? https://youtu.be/HX7x3PDBXtg"
,"People have varying degrees of spinal curvature, and it sounds like you have less than most people.

Chair recco - Canada,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been researching chairs for a few weeks and no definite winner. My budget is 400$ Canadian and I am 5‚Äô10 female who works from home and spend a lot of time on the chair because one of my hobbies is painting and I end up on the chair post work too. 
I‚Äôve got Nouhaus + Posture Ergonomic and Office Star Mid back Pro grind in my cart as of now. I‚Äôm open to other suggestions as well but happy to hear between these 2 chairs. Thank you üôèüèΩ"
Mesh hate?,"Hey everyone so I've been using one of those Amazon basics chairs for about 4-5 years and have been looking for an improvement for my setup. I happened upon this sub and am a bit confused. I see all of the popular recommendations for chairs and about 90% of them all use mesh. My chair also has mesh (Mesh back, cushion, armrests) and I have grown to dislike it over the years. Whenever I use the armrests on my chair for any extended amount of time (gamer) it always leaves my arms irritated and have an indent of the mesh design on my arms. I personally don't mind the mesh back all that much but to me from an aesthetic perspective it doesn't seem all that appealing. Now I know that office chairs are more about ergonomics than looks, but aesthetics do mean a fair deal to me. I don't prefer the mesh cushion all that much because it has similar problems to the armrests and is uncomfortable after extended periods of time. I have two working theories as to the reason I don't like mesh office chairs at the moment and those are: 1. The amazon basics mesh are garbage and you shouldn't expect to get anything more than usable at an $80 price-point, the more premium mesh is much better and actually feels nice. Or 2. It's just a preference and I just don't prefer mesh chair designs. That being said, I know most gamer chairs don't have mesh designs but that is not at all what I'm going for and personally feel like ""gamer chairs"" are way too gimmicky, overpriced, cheesy, and uncomfortable for me to even remotely consider buying. Essentially, I'm looking for an office chair that  will fit a dude around 5' 10'' and I'm most interested in fabric chairs since they seem like the best meet in the middle option for me. My price range is around $200-$300 new or used and am hoping to find one that has white color options and will last a long time. Thanks

TLDR: I don't get the hype of mesh chairs as I find them uncomfortable myself. I am looking for a chair (preferably fabric) that's around $200-$300 new or used that has white color options and will last a long time."
,"I think you shouldn‚Äôt judge mesh chairs by the standards of your Amazon mesh chair.. have you checked out the list of this sub‚Äôs recommended office chairs? There‚Äôs a few on there that you can easily afford if you look hard enough (used) - not sure about the white color options though, good luck with that one!"
,"You're not alone in a dislike for mesh chairs, that's why most of the high end market isn't mesh.

That being said, don't judge them based on a cheap, no-brand chair. What matters far more than mesh or not mesh, is quality of chair and quality of the brand that produces it. 

Ignore gamer chairs completely, ignore most amazon chairs. Go for proven brands or proven models with very high reviews. There's some great lists on this subreddit to comb through. And I don't say this to try and snob, but there absolutely are lots of bad chairs out there and going with the tride and true is key. But that doesn't mean just grab the aeron or the gesture and call it a day, the high end market is still quite wide and finding the perfect match for you is helpful.

If you're open to buying used, all is available to you.

If you're buying new at that price range, Clatina Mellet, Staples Ayalon, and the Bowery chair come to mind at the moment as decent options. Ikea Markus is also not bad."
,Mesh armrests are extremely rare. Most mesh chairs don't have mesh armrests because mesh can be abrasive on bare skin. Especially cheap mesh.
,Clatina Mallet! I have one and love it!
,"I can't recall any new all-fabric chairs in the $200-300 price range worth recommending besides perhaps the CLATINA Mellet, but there are better-built chairs out there with nicer mesh than what you currently have. I recommend checking out the SitOnIt Wit and Novo chairs from shop.sitonit.net. They're built unusually well for the price and come in lots of color options, including white frames. Given your height, be sure to select the high backrest and adjustable seat depth options!"
Budget Chair Recommendations?,"Are there any decent chairs around/under 250 USD that come with decent warranty/protection plans in case the hydraulics start failing or the arm wrists come apart? 

So far I think my best choice might be the Clatina Mellet (or rather, [this off-brand copy on ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/115204998643)) since I don't want a chair that has mesh or forces me into a certain seating position. (I like to move around a lot in my chair and sometimes sit cross-legged.) Headrest would be nice, but isn't a huge deal breaker for me. 

Are there better recommendations for me (6ft 250lbs / 1.82m 114kg) in this price range, or should I go with the Clatina Mellet? Thanks!"
Clatina Mellet Reviews,"Hey all,

Quick question to see if anyone actually has had their gas cylinder go through the bottom base.

Wondering if those complaint reviews on amazon are just one off or if this is actually a common occurrence.


Thanks,"
,"I‚Äôve had one for a month and have no complaints. Then again, it‚Äôs only a month :)"
,Just chiming in that I've had my Mellet three months with no issues so far. This is my first ergonomic chair and I've been happy with it. The adjustable locking on the recline is nice for my varying amounts of laziness throughout the day.
,"Been using mine now for abut 6 months, the cylinder does sit pretty low to the ground but as far as I can tell its position has been unchanged since I first got it, despite heavy usage."
Office chair recommendations,"So I‚Äôm pretty new to this and I use an automous.io ergo chair 2 right now. I was looking for a replacement as I‚Äôd like something for long gaming and work sessions. I sit in my chair (as I‚Äôm sure many do) for quite a while every day and I‚Äôm looking for something comfortable. Im average height 5‚Äô11 and don‚Äôt require anything super robust. I was looking at the offerings from steelcase aswell as Herman miller and shopping for a chair at those price ranges is quite new for me. I know there are authorized dealers for them but I don‚Äôt believe there are any very close to me. Is there anything in particular I‚Äôm really looking for between these families of chairs? The gesture from steelcase and embody/ aeron all seem like good chairs made with different functions in mind. How can I narrow this down? I know the easiest option is to go to a dealer but I‚Äôd love to hear your recommendations. I come from mostly using mesh chairs but don‚Äôt have any qualms against alternative materials. I know this question is super vague and probably asked a bunch, but any input would be great. Thanks."
,"Is there anything more or less important to you in a chair (lower back support, seat comfort, etc...)? Is there anything specifically about the Ergo Chair 2 you have now that you like or dislike? This info may help in making some recommendations :)

Chair Cover?,"Hi, wanted to ask what is this cloth that covers the chair? 

[https://imgur.com/a/6CTUG40](https://imgur.com/a/6CTUG40)

&#x200B;

I think the chair is Sihoo m57 but I not sure if this includes this chair cover? 

&#x200B;

Thanks"
,Just curious what this would be good for?
,"It looks like something [like this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CMAKER-Slipcover-Washable-Removable-Protector/dp/B09RWLWYM2/)  - I have one on my chair as the faux leather is peeling off and stops it flaking to the floor and making a mess and it looks tidier. However the ,m57 is a mesh so it maybe they just don't like the texture of mesh, although the thin spandex wouldn't help hugely with that."
,"Autonomous Kinn. Or I think they call it the Ergochair Pro now to avoid association with all the bad reviews. I would avoid this chair, it's overpriced and bad build quality. For a similar price range, and a similar design but better, I would look at the Bowery chair.

https://youtu.be/X6vhYU8UzwM"
,"I had this chair for a week. It‚Äôs insanely stiff and makes a ton of noise. The back mesh was amazing though. I bought it second hand, it nowhere near worth the asking price. 

Your tail bone WILL hurt."
,If you like that design I suggest the Herman Miller celle unupholstered and the Life chair by knoll.
,Thank you for replying y‚Äòall!
,That‚Äôs the overcomplicated spiderweb-mesh unfomfy chair 2000.
,It‚Äôs the Autonomous Kinn chair. It‚Äôs a Herman Miller Embody and Haworth Fern knock-off.
Should I just go for the Haworth Soji or better wait for Black Friday deals?,"I  have been thinking on getting a Haworth Soji and with the current deal it is really tempting. But I do not know if I am better off waiting for Black Friday deals or just get the Soji. My other issue is that I have never tried out the Soji since it does not have an display store in my country.

I had bad experiences with cheaper chair that would either bottom out or the gas piston will give out after 2 or 3 years of use.

My current budget is around $500 USD

My dimensions: 170cm, 107 kg"
,"I used their previous low end offering, the Haworth Lively Task.  It seems like the Soji replaced this chair.  Mine was fully loaded, 4D arms, adjustable lumbar, forward tilt etc. and I liked it very much."
,"I‚Äôm in the same boat and hope people who have the Soji chime in! The sale now is really tempting but it seems they had an even better deal last year for Black Friday (and may have more options in fabric and colors). 

FWIW, I have sat in the Soji (briefly, in a showroom) and it seemed very comfortable."
,"The Soji is a good chair for the price, but it is still a budget minded chair. As a general rule, Black Friday sales are usually worth waiting for, and you may be able to get into a higher end chair at the same price point. Unless you need something right away, I'd consider waiting. Also worth considering would be to spend the money on the Soji now and return it if it doesn't work out for you and then shop Black Friday sales only if the Soji isn't the chair for you.

,Since Haworth has short warantys on functional parts it can also happen IMO. Save bet is a used Herman Miller Aeron those barely ever die
Amazon Chairs,"I was looking on amazon UK for a new office chair for around 150 pounds and the brands just re upload each others chairs and put their own branding on it and some of the posts have fake reviews.  
Is amazon just full of these and just have a terrible chair market?  
I could also look on Ikea or any other uk places but I'm not sure what to buy, any suggestions?  
And yes I've looked on the used market and yes they're still overpriced."
,Just go to Ikea and buy the Markus.
,$5 maybe
Steelcase Amia rattle,"Just received a new Steelcase Amia chair and have no issues aside from a small annoying rattle coming from the left side armrest. It looks like the plastic cover directly under the armrest is wobbly compared the other side which does not rattle. Will unscrewing the pad on top allow me to then tighten this plastic cover or is it more complex than that?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rxnmygjqxgq91.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdbf6faf00d6623ac03387ae0dead9ec28181f61"
,"Generally the plastic is a little loose, but if you can tighten it yes you would have to remove the armcap. I wouldn't worry about it much imo, it's purely there as a loose fitting cover for the actual mechanisms."
,The plastic cover is not held in place by screws (if I recall correctly) but simply tiny clips molded into the plastic. It has no functional purpose other than providing a clean aesthetic. The chair functions perfectly fine with or without the black cover. If the rattling bothers you then just remove the armpad and remove the black cover.
,"Adding the gesture to the list of high end chairs I‚Äôve found. Figured I‚Äôd do a bit of a quick impression / comparison between all the different chairs I‚Äôve bought off Facebook and offer up so far! 

Herman miller embody: probably has the best recline in the game, super smooth and even lets you push it back further than the stopping point due to the back design. Comfort is initially really good, however after using it for a week I developed lower back discomfort due to what I assume is lack of adjustability in that area. Also, the arm adjustments are terrible but it has really nice plush arm pads! Ended up selling it.

Herman miller aeron remastered: I liked the looks of this one but I guess I must not be a fan of mesh seats, I could not get comfortable in it. Recline was solid though (as all hm chairs are) 

Herman miller sayl: beautiful chair but just kinda meh overall comfort wise. The lumbar support was surprisingly decent though

Steelcase leap v2: probably the most comfortable chair overall just sitting in it, however there are still some things I did not like about this chair. Mainly, the recline was not my favorite. I can see why people would like it, but it‚Äôs more of a sliding recline than a smooth lean back kinda thing. It‚Äôs pretty hard to explain but there‚Äôs friction there and it will hold you where you choose to stop reclining, although I like to rock in my chairs so this was not for me. Also the lumbar was a bit finicky and kinda hard on my back .

Steelcase leap v1: more plush than the v2, but I still preferred the v2. The arms are less adjustable but the v1 has a bonus feature that the v2 doesn‚Äôt have where it lets you adjust the ‚Äúlip‚Äù of the seat up or down. 

Steelcase gesture: first impressions are really good, I like the lumbar a bit more than the leap (it‚Äôs less intense). The arms are by far the best, like they are so good. I wish the pads were softer though. The recline is much better than the leap v2 imo but I still think the embody has the best recline... the gesture still sort of stops you like the leap did but the recline motion is way better. this one might be my favorite overall so far

Steelcase think v1 and v2: v2 is better, definitely can‚Äôt sit in these for more than like 5 hours though. I like the recline on them but there‚Äôs not really a tension adjustment 

Haworth very: almost as good of a recline as the embody, the seat isn‚Äôt super plush and I don‚Äôt love the back. The arms are also SUPER flimsy feeling but honestly if you can find this under $50 it‚Äôs a good pick up

Still on the lookout for a Haworth fern, that‚Äôs the last chair in my office chair bingo"

Herman Miller Sayl OR Steelcase Leap V2,"Hi guys,

I'm quite new to the office chair community, and I definitely do not want to spend money on "" gaming chairs ""

I'm recently looking into upgrading my office chairs, happen to find good deals online for both the Herman Miller Sayl Full upgraded for 450SGD, additionally I also manage to find Steelcase Leap v2 for the same price of 450SGD? ( both like new )

Since the pricing is the same, which one of the chairs do you recommend? Do feel free and include your personal experience with the chair. ( Sayl is full loaded, Leap v2 one is fully loaded, while the other one did not state )

Just for some additional information, I am 175cm in height, looking for a chair that provide very good comfortable siting experience as well as an awesome back support for long hours of working / gaming at home.

Thank you all for taking your time and helping me out !

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/xpk1nw)"
,"I personally don't think the two chairs are on the same planet with regards to comfort. The Leap V2 also offers superior adjustments in the mid-back and low-back tension, and the sliding lumbar support."
,"If heat/sweat is a factor, the Sayl is a much cooler chair than the swamp-back Leap."
,where on earth can you get a like new leap v2 for sgd450 in singapore? honestly curious
,"Keen to understand how HAG Sofi compares with Steelcase and Herman Miller too, if anyone could chip in"
,"I had a Leap and it was quite uncomfortable for me, also a Haworth Fern, not for me. Both highly regarded chairs, but at the end of the day, you need that bumtime on that chair to know. If you can, try to test them for at least a week (month is better), or since you are buying on a discount you have probably good chances to pass them on with minimal loss.   
Whatever your decision I hope it works out, what I am trying to say is don't be surprised if it does not.  


I am actually buying a Sayl tomorrow after testing a Haworth Zody (which had my tailbone in pain in no time). At work we have Haworth Sojis which seem to be perfect for my bottom, I just could not find any of those used, and a new one is not something I am willing to invest into atm.   


Good luck whatever chair you go with!"
,"If you‚Äôre in Singapore, come by my showroom at 49 Cantonment road. I work with Flokk.com - we‚Äôve got a plethora of ergonomic chairs which match Steelcase and Herman Miller. My chairs are the H√ÖG Sofi Mesh, Capisco and Capisco Puls.

Happy to walk you through the chairs and find you your best solution."
"Tried all herman miller and steelcase models, still unsure","Embody: didnt like the the feel i like to stay upright and it was reclining too much.

Mirra 2: it was ok on lumbar support but felt too stiff

Aeron: felt somewhat right but felt you can sit only a certain way

Steelcase Leap v2: tried the leather, didnt like, tried the fabric and felt comfy

Steelcase Gesture: felt very good for everything exept the higher back part, didnt feel much support there


I previously had a SIHOO M18 and have to say that it offered pretty good value for 250. Good lumbar support and decent headrest, made me sit up straight and comfy.

I want a headrest cause I like to rest my neck, so im thinking about the leap refurbished, but I really dont want to spent 150 just on the headrest mod. I can get a refurbished leap for 350. Aeron was also good but they are pricier and not really worth it imo.

Was looking for something else maybe with headrest included so I dont have to mod anything (dont have the tools), or if I don't find anything else I really might for again for the SIHOO M18. What do you guys think?"
,Did u try the gesture w headrest or maybe Haworth fern
,"Nightingale CXO? Warning though, the head rest sucks, but is removable. Arms are also removable. I have one and it's pretty good. Aeron RM provides best back support."
,"Did you give each of them a week or two? Or just try them briefly in the showroom. And did you make sure to adjust them properly to yourself.

For other steelcase chairs, I highly recommend the Amia.

For Haworth, the Fern and Zody are great. But neither have amazing headrests. 

Human scale freedom could work, but it's not for everyone. It's god a unique headrest."
,Trying in a shop is not enough. It's better than nothing but unfortunately nothing like having these home for a while to understand how much better they are vs crappy white brand chairs.
,Steelcase Amia?
Can I swap a mechanism for a different one?,"Could I swap a mechanism such as this: [Link 1](https://d3ugyf2ht6aenh.cloudfront.net/stores/002/007/282/products/mecanismo-borboleta1-11-a778d4fa8503961d8d16490994385263-640-0.jpg) for one like this: [Link 2](https://d3ugyf2ht6aenh.cloudfront.net/stores/002/007/282/products/mecanismo-frog-31-cd9c6c0ef8a93fb43f16490996656906-640-0.jpg)?

,I believe neither chair's cushion will ever bottom out on you. What features does each chair have?

Aeron Hurman Miller,Can someone give me more info on this chair? We rent an office and are upgrading size at a new location. I asked the regus office lady how much it would cost to buy as I like it so much. It is still in very good shape. She said $250 for it which I‚Äôm wondering is a good price? Seems like a very old model by the date? I know they can be quite pricey but will someone with more knowledge on this model let me know if this is a fair price? Thank you!
,Great price

How long does the padding last on a Leap V2?,"I've had my V2 for 4 years now and I'm not sure but I think that my seat cushion is flattened a bit. I sat in what I thought was a new one at University which was significantly thicker in both the seat and backrest. I was honestly really surprised since I didn't think my chair had been flattened that much. I'm 6'4"" 190lbs so nothing abnormal in terms of personal dimensions. 

What do you all think?  Is it possible my chair has worn down this much or is there some new padding on newer V2s that are sold these days?"
,It could've been a referb chair with thicker padding... Crandall and BTOD I think do that. I dunno if anyone else does or how prevalent chairs like that are tho.
,Some Steelcase chairs offer a thicker seat option. Perhaps your university purchased some of those.
,"The padding with definitely compress a bit over time, but will vary a bit depending on the amount of use and the user in the chair. This is mostly seen on the seat, and not as much on the back. Is it possible the Leap you sat in at the University was a V1 Highback? That would have both thicker OEM seat and back pads.

,"I received an Aeron classic from Crandall this weekend (took 14 days from order to delivery). I was very excited to have it at home but unfortunately it is noisy when moving it and reclining. It makes this metallic sound when moving (not sure where that is coming from) and it creaks while reclining (https://i.imgur.com/AyLrUM0.mp4). I think that is coming from the plastic box at the base, which is very flimsy and noisy to the touch.

It's not what I expected from a +$700 chair (Tbh I expected dead silence) and it just feels very low quality to be honest. I thought that Crandall would have more quality control. The chair itself is nice and looks brand-new but the noise issue is quite bad. Hopefully there's a way to fix it, if not I'll be returning."

Leap V2 seat cushion is way too hard,"I got a refurbished Leap V2 from BTOD last week and within 30 mins of sitting my thighs start hurting, and if I don't readjust every 10 minutes they'll start to tingle and go numb.

I'm kind of disappointed since I spent over $600 on it, and even with the added foam (supposedly) it's still just way too hard. It's nearly unbearable to sit on after a few hours.

Has anyone had a similar issue?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just going to return it, I've tried every setting in nearly every combination and I still get the same issue. The best combination of seat depth and chair height I found still jabs into my right thigh and is painful after 5-10 minutes."
,"I have an ancient v1 with a flat lumpy seat pad so I use a additional gel pad with it.

You may also have your seat adjusted incorrectly. It could be your seat is too high or low and you're putting to much pressure on your butt or legs respectively. Personally I frequently put my seat too low and then it feels too hard because my butt is supporting both thighs and body weight. If your legs are tingly you may also have the seat depth too deep and be pinching the back of your calves affecting circulation. You can also adjust the front lip portion of the seat to be more angled and keep from pinching your legs as much."
,I'm using a gel cushion on mine. Try and get one too.
,Tingling and numbness can occur because your the seat is *too* plush. High-end ergonomic chair manufacturers make medium-firm seats because research shows soft/plush seats are less comfortable for long sitting sessions than firmer seats.

Steelecase Gesture w Headrest 2 day in...,"Just got my Steelcase Gesture w/ headrest and lumbar.  My previous was DXRacer gaming chair.  I'm not gonna say its life changing, but there is a difference in comfort level, how my lower back and butt is not achy and constant need to adjust (thus why I switched out the DXRacer after 4yrs) 

The pro's : adjustability.  I'm still fitgiting with the chair to get the right ergonomics. the lumber feels great. 

The con's: not sure if its con, but the headrest I'm still trying to find the right adjustment, but its like cm's away from my head, a slight lean back and I'm hitting it.  In my head, I feel like when I sit on this chair, it should feel like a lazy boy or a comfy couch, but its not supposed to be like that.  Its supposed to be an ergonomic chair promoting proper fit? 

So I'm still getting used to it. I'm definitely keeping it, and getting used to this ergonomic super chair."

Advice on finding chair for uncommon back pain issue,"Hello!  I'm trying to get a chair for my dad and his sort of uncommon back issues/situation.  I'm calling it uncommon though perhaps the type of pain is common?  I'm calling it so because I know a lot of normal chairs, car seats, couches etc hurt my dad's back.  I'm not even sure what search terms I should look for.  While I'm also doing google searches and reading reviews, I found this sub too and was hoping to get some tips from people who are knowledgeable \^\_\_\^  I apologize if this turns out to be a long post... I want to give details and I hope I'm making sense...

My dad had polio when he was a kid and had the subsequent back surgery.  The way I understand it is his spine is somewhat fused so he can't curve his back in the normal way.  This puts a lot of pressure on his back where it hurts unless he's able to lean his arm on something just under shoulder height such as turning a dining room chair to the side and resting his arm on the back while sitting.  He can also relieve the pressure by leaning forward on both arms on his desk. 

The leaning forward has been making his neck hurt and he expressed that he'd like to have a chair that supports his neck if he leans back for a bit.  So far these are the things I'm hoping to find in a chair -- or at least as many as possible:

\- Adjustable arm height/angle.  (Is there a chair out there where the arms can be adjusted super high up?)   
\- High back with adjustable neck support height (my dad is short because of the polio, about 5'2""ish)  
\- Wheel locks or stationary so that it doesn't slide out under him when he gets up or sits down  
\- Swivel lock(?) for stability when he sits down and ease for when he needs to turn to get up  
\- Adjustable seat depth - is this the right term?  Again, he's short so something with too long of a seat will make his legs dangle  
\- Adjustable lumbar support  
\- Adjustable back angle that will lock in place

Are there any specific search terms other than what I've written or any specific ""medical desk chair"" brands I should make sure I look at while I'm doing my research?

My apologies for the long post and if I wasn't articulate enough.  I am absolutely going to look up as much as I can but since I really want to help my dad with his back pain with a good, safe for him chair I'd appreciate any and all suggestions and help!  Thank you for taking the time to read!  \^\_\_\_\^"
,I don't know what chair to recommend tbh but your dad might be short enough to where he can probably use most ergonomic chair arms at full extension and if not a pad can be added to add extra height. You're the second person on here asking for swivel lock and I'm not even sure that's a thing that's offered. For his back I'd recommend something like mesh.

chair like hyken in similar price range with movable arms?,"I just bought a staples hyken chair to replace the Ikea jarvfellet that I absolutely hated. so far the hyken is seems fine, certainly much better than the jarvfellet for me.

thing is when I set up the hyken I put the arm rests on at first and worked and played some games for a few hours and realized I quite liked having arm rests

when it was time to play guitar though, I obviously had to take the arms off.  still comfortable, but I kind of got quickly hooked on having the option of arm rests. 

I don't really have the budget right now to go in to the high end market

so I'm wondering if there are any chairs similar in design to the hyken, not too much more expensive, with arms that I can move out of the way for playing guitar, that aren't complete garbage

So I am new to this subreddit and high end office chairs as well so I'm not sure what the deal could be here. Not sure why this person has two (a white one as well) of this chair which is fully loaded and selling for such a huge amount under retail.

Is this a red flag and what should I look for if I go check it out? Are there many fakes or knock offs of these high end chairs in general?"
,"Fakes are almost non-existent, and the very few ""fakes"" that do exist are almost always overseas and if they do exist in the US--they are pretty obvious to spot as long as you do the bare minimum amount of research into what a real chair looks like. 

This chair is likely new and likely ""free"" for the seller, as in, this chair fell off the back of someone's truck or it was likely overstock. The seller likely paid in the ballpark of $0-300 for this chair. 

The price is within the ballpark of fair, sure. But to be clear, we are talking about a gray-market chair, and gray-market chairs will naturally be priced lower (or should be priced lower) than their white-market counterparts."
,"Ask if they can do 600... Grey market, blue market, purple market... You wanna spend 1000 plus? or do you want to spend less than that. It's up to you.

Warranty/good return policy seems only good to me if you're going to be trying it out and aren't sure. If your back is wrecked already from some office chair that isn't as good it can be a great deal."
,"To counter what the other poster said my local dealer sells stock chairs around that price. The dealers get the chairs at a wholesale price less than what you see if direct ordering from the Steelcase site for their own profit. There is also some extra margin built into the MSRP for organizational sales discounts. If you are buying 100+ chairs you also aren't paying MSRP. 

That is without even getting into returns to dealer or clearance of lightly used demo chairs."

What you're describing is called a tilt lock. All these high-end office chair manufacturers make chairs with a superior tilt limiter, which stops you from reclining past a certain angle, but still supports you when you want to sit up. If you want to simulate a tilt lock on any of these chairs, just loosen the tilt tension until the backrest no longer pushes you upright at all."

Tighten the 4d arms for Haworth Fern?,"Got my chair at the beginning of the week. So far I love everything about it, except the armrests. Comfort wise, they are great. But they slide forward/backward a tad too easily when getting in and out. I've found the manual for it, and it looks fairly easy to disassemble them. But my question is, is it possible to make the sliding part tighter/stiffer? Don't want to go through the hassle of taking it apart only to realize it can't be done.  


Edit: I would up taking it apart. After trying a couple different methods, I think I came up with a good solution. Here it all finished, but [in this picture](https://i.imgur.com/qbSX4JZ.jpg) you can see the channel in the which the pad slides forwards and backwards. That silver nut was already as tight as it would go. I tried tape, paper wedges, and those 2 solutions didn't work well. The tape and paper would get bunched up after a couple slides. I wound up using the [plastic from a 3 ring binder folder](https://i.imgur.com/xMGeCYY.jpg) and some really thin 2 sided tape I had that I bought for part of a bike project. [This is where I put it](https://i.imgur.com/lhktGhA.jpg). One side, I had to use 2 layers, the other just one. Still slides very smooth, but now require a bit of force to move it. 

All that is needed for Haworth to fix this is to just make that piece of plastic a tad thicker. Kinda sucks to have to do this to a 1k chair, but oh well.

Edit#2: Thought about it more. I tried just adding a washer under the silver nut to push down on that piece of plastic more. It worked, too much actually. Was too tight and it raised the rear of the pad some. Was surprised that just one washer would make it that much tighter :-/

I ordered some really thin shim washers to play with. Will be here tomorrow. Will report back if it works. The washer solution is a lot cleaner, so hopefully it does."
,"They shouldn't move overly easily. Mines are very stable and firm and at the same time easy to slide. But contact Haworth, I'm sure they can send a technician to your house."
,"That's kind of how they are. 

I personally didn't like the 4D arms that much on the Fern because of this and because the sloped angle means my arms just slide off."
Chair choice for a tall and big girl in Europe,"So yeah, I'm 192cm (that's 6""2') tall and weigh 120kg (260 pounds), and I use my desk for both work and fun - ideally I'd have two desks and a separate ""play"" area with a couch, but that's not currently an option, so I'd appreciate an option to recline. I'm in the Netherlands, which makes a lot of the advice I find around here a bit hard to apply, and with my anxiety I lean towards new products.

In the past I used a tall Marcus chair that miraculously fit me, but it's dying, the mesh attracts cats like catnip, and honestly I find the headrest really pushing me too far forward when I try to sit ""upright"".

Oh, and my knees are at about 60cm (depends where you think the knee is, exactly), and in-seam at 90. Buying stockings is hell only exceeded by attempts to buy trousers.

I use a motorized standing desk, and maybe that's why I still don't suffer from back pain despite otherwise quite unhealthy habits. I'm trans, so my proportions might be a bit different than you'd expect from a girl otherwise - but on HRT for quite a while.

I've been trying to pick between two chairs in my price range (let's say ""up to 900 but I'd rather not reach that much) and I was looking at two options:

- [Schaffenburg 400NPR](https://www.coolblue.nl/product/864647/schaffenburg-400npr-comfort-bureaustoel.html) at Coolblue.

  This is the ""okay, let's accept it's a work chair"" option. I'd get rid of the armrests because I hate those :D and I'd miss the recline, but it seems like a solid chair and has good reviews _on the site_. Unfortunately I can't really find anything much about the company otherwise, and that makes me quite anxious.

- [Secretlab TITAN Evo 2022 Series](https://secretlab.eu/products/titan-evo-2022-series), bought directly.

  I've had coworkers talk well about Secretlab, but they're all quite a bit shorter than me. Also it _is_ a gaming chair - and they have a hot pink option, but no purple options that's not heavily branded with games I don't like, which is kinda depressing :D - but jokes aside, the grey one looks _fine_. It has shorter warranty (5 vs 10 years) and costs more. Looks better for relaxing, but worse for work.

I'd appreciate if someone shared  any experiences with Schaffenburg, and tall+big experiences with using the Secretlab chair. Furthermore, if anyone could comment on the how much of a cat-attractor their upholstery is.

Also: like a surprising amount of women (and apparently not just trans) I like to shift around between some really odd positions (like, say, cross legged on a chair, putting a leg up, standing, chair-backwards, all that stuff) - to the point of considering some ""alternative"" chairs - but turns out the kneeling chairs are pretty bad for knees?"

,"For sciatica, forward seat tilt tends to relieve pressure off the thighs and buttocks by diverting more weight to your feet. Unfortunately, neither Herman Miller nor Steelcase make chairs with forward tilt except the Aeron, which is a particularly bad for sciatica due to its hard seat frame.

The [Sitmatic Goodfit Multifunction High-Back Chair](https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/9788821/Sitmatic-GoodFit-Multifunction-High-Back-Chair) is a well-built, well-cushioned chair with forward seat tilt that would be a good fit for you."

Thinking about getting a Remanufactured Gesture from Crandall. Thoughts?,Has anyone gone this route for buying an office chair?Anything I should be aware of before pulling the trigger? What‚Äôs the build quality like and is it worth it given the discounted price you are getting‚Ä¶Also is the 12 year warranty in effect for these chairs even though they are remanufactured and not coming directly from Steelcase?
,I'm sure crandaddy will chime in  shortly
,They're great. Only issue is I find my seat cushion to have flattened out too much in a couple of years. If there's an option for the thicker cushion they offer take it.
,I bought a new one a few months ago and while I love it I needed a memory foam cushion as well because the seat foam is too thin. Sucks for a $1700 chair tbh.
,"Get a Crandall, people like it. I have a gesture, it's alright."
,"I got a remanufactured leap v2 from crandall recently. I think for the price, it's decent. But you have to be aware that you get what you pay for as well.

I use a leap v2 from steelcase at my office, so I got a leap v2 from Crandall to work from home as well. The chair I received from Crandall has significantly more seat wiggle / play when I move it back and forth along the seat depth compared to the chair in my office. It's something that I immediately notice whenever I shift around, and the sound of the seat movement hitting its limit is noticeable even with headphones on. I know this model is supposed to have some seat movement because of the way the plastic guides on the seat and the gliders you install are designed, but the difference is noticeable coming from a non-remanufactured chair. 

So what I am getting at is, whether its because I got a beat up heavily used frame, or Crandall's non-OEM parts are not as snug as   original Steelcase parts, your chair probably won't be like new. But at the end of the day it's a chair, not a spaceship, and it works fine - annoyances aside. 

Lastly, I know the CEO posts here and its good for optics but I have my doubts whether they back it up. I've been back and forth with the customer service and I've been told my issue is within the acceptable tolerance, but YMMV."

Most adjustable chair with mesh seat besides Aeron?,"I have Steelcase Gesture and the cushion is just horrendous. 

I can live with it's other features, and **love** only the adjustable arms (although I wish they were not using discrete steps, but could be fine-tuned with smooth adjustment).

So I wonder if I should sell this <1 year old Gesture and get somethign else. My new office chair must have a mesh seat I am 100% certain about that.

So what is the most adjustable office chair with the mesh seat that is not Aeron (I  had it and it never felt right ,also the arms were not adjustable enough)."
,I feel like mesh seat chairs aren‚Äôt as common as they should be. I‚Äôve been considering the WorkPro Quantum 9000 as an alternative to the Aeron.

Is 2ndhnd worth it? Looking to buy a Steelcase (Leap or Gesture),"My country doesn‚Äôt have a robust used market for chairs, and the few ones that are there are like a 6hr drive from where I am.

,"I recently got a Leap V2 off them.

Took about a week for them to ship it and the one they sent had no 4D adjustable arms or lumbar support.

I emailed them and they were quick to respond and pretty apologetic saying they have multiple versions (which is why the descriptions are a bit vauge) of the chairs in stock and they offered to send me another chair with 4D arms and lumbar support and said they will arrange a collection for the other chair at no cost.

Again, I had to wait another week or so but it came exactly as described and I couldn't be happier with it.

Overall I'd say they're very good but if you're going to buy one off them it would be worth talking to someone to make sure you get the version you want. Also, if you sign up for their email when it pops up on the website, you can get a 10% discount which saved me like ¬£40 and then just unsubscribe from the emails."

In Mexico these are 500+ USDA for any age okay condition. They make the chair in Mexico. And yes, a 2017 275 leapv2 can be a good deal depending on condition.

I‚Äôve been eyeing the steelcase gesture, but I‚Äôm just not sure. I‚Äôve always had shitty chairs that were $100 and under.

Should I get a headrest? I have chronic neck and back pain, but it is mostly controlled with physical therapy and I don‚Äôt want to jinx it. The gesture headrest looks like it pushes the head forward real far.

Do the nicer chairs ever have a small discount, even like 5-10% off?"
,"Leap v2 or gesture. Done.

No headrest. That‚Äôs only used if
You like to sleep in your chair or recline way back for a long time which is probably not often. I‚Äôve gotten fancy headrests on my chairs and literally they make no difference for normal sitting."
,"in this class there are a lot of great options, but everyone will tell you that the selection is still intensely personal. I would suggest trying what you can, maybe buying used if you are gunshy and want to try a higher end chair out."
,"I cannot say yet what the sale will be or when exactly it will start, but I can say Steelcase will most certainty have a Holiday Sale coming before the end of 2022 that may be worth holding out for if you can wait for it.

Its a live changing decision to decide to upgrade from the cheap chairs to a high end ergonomic chair from a reputable name brand. You will not regret it.

Steelcase Gesture is their flagship model and is their most advanced product available, but it is not for everyone. Also typically takes a couple days of getting used to if you're not used to an ergonomic chair you may feel a bit of discomfort as your body adjusts to a more optimal sitting posture.

As for the headrest, that's all up to ones personal preference. The gesture with headrest definitely does LOOK like it will push your head forward, but it does not feel that way for everyone. I would try before you buy if possible.

Although I am currently using a gesture without the headrest (as I personally never prefer headrests on any of my work chairs), I will say that we sell significantly more Gestures with Headrests than without so that may give you a perspective of what is more popular.

Hope this helps!

,"Yes for headrest if you have a weak neck like I do and/or are tall. 

I have the Steelcase Amia at work. Super nice, no headrest, gets the job done if you‚Äôre alert. 

Get a high back chair with a minimalist headrest. Something like the IKEA JARFVJALLET whatever it‚Äôs called, but do not buy an IKEA chair. The general shape is good though."
Aeron Seat Pad Leans Forward,"Do any Aeron owners experience this and is there a way to adjust it?  

I‚Äôm not talking about the forward tilt settings; I have that at the furthest-back position. I‚Äôm not sure why anyone would lock their chair in any of the forward-tilting settings."
,"maybe it's loose? 

I love using the forward tilt function, it relieves pressure from under your knees and is good for sitting up straight when you're really focusing on something."
steelcase leap headrest,I've read the standard headrest isn't good.  are there alternatives that will attach?
,"I believe there are aftermarket 3rd Party headrests that can be fixed onto a Leap chair. However, I would only recommend this if you bought your chair used/refurbished with no warranty as adding a 3rd Party headrest could potentially damage the integrity of the chair and void Steelcase's factory warranty if any problems arise in the future.  


Headrests work differently for everybody, I would strongly suggest trying one yourself in person if possible before taking someone else's opinion on them to heart. We haven't had any customers come back to complain about their Leap's Headrest, but we definitely sell more Leaps without headrest than with as that generally seems to be the more popular option among consumers. Hope this helps.

Is the Herman Miller Aeron worth it?,"I can‚Äôt find any good chairs in europe, all the ones highly praised here like Steelcase are very US specific it seems. 

I found a site to buy a Herman Miller Aeron refurbished for 1000$ , however then the warranty is only for 1 year, would you say this is worth it or no? 

Ive had so much problems finding a chair, and there‚Äôs not many shops here in which I can try them, except ikea."
,"Don't buy refurb for 1k holy shit. You pay so much because you get 12 years waranty on everything!! You can get new ones in europe starting at like 1.2k. I would say Aeron is hit or miss tho, you should definitely test it first if you can't send it back! Also every european country has comparable companies with very good chairs. Definitely go to a local dealer and test some as well!"
,"I hated the edges of the seat as with the way I sat on it, it ""cuts"" my thighs."
,"In general, the premise we follow here on this sub is that good ergonomic chairs are better than chairs that are not designed with ergonomics in mind.

Herman Miller Aeron is probably the most popular in the category of ergonomic chairs and most people who use them love them.  

Steelcase does have a global dealer presence. The secondary market is not nearly as good in most countries as it is here in the us. That's true."
,Yup. Refurbished id probably pay $700 max
,"All chairs are subjective to ones personal preferences in what they need in a chair. Its not for everyone and you should definitely try before you buy. Especially when it comes to their size options (A,B,C/S,M,L). That being said, there's a reason why the Herman Miller Aeron has the world renown reputation that it has as debatably the all around best office chair available on the market for over a decade.  


A lot of the value in the chair comes from buying new directly from HM or one of their authorized retailers. As others have mentioned, their 12 year factory warranty is very valuable. Herman Miller takes great care of their customers when they have issues and even if a 3rd party claims to match it, dealing with them can be an entirely different experience.  


Also in regards to refurbs, all I'm going to say is don't be fooled by a re-upholstered Aeron chair. The authentic HM Mesh material is patented and they have spent tens of millions of $$ on research into the quality and design of their Mesh to stay a step above the competition. If someone refurbished an Aeron chair with cheap aftermarket Mesh, it would defeat the whole purpose of buying the chair to begin with.

,"In general, yes, very worth it. But I wouldn‚Äôt buy used myself."
"Need actual recommendations, I can‚Äôt trust the YouTube hype.","I recently transitioned to working from home three days a week, and have always been a very avid gamer and YouTube connoisseur.

,"Generally speaking unlike many other industries, it's pretty hard to hype a chair unless it's actually a good chair, lol."
,"Definitely ditch the ikea stool if you're spending over 8 hours a day in a chair! When I see posts like this, I have to give my broken-record response of please invest in yourself! Similar to the endless health benefits of having a high quality mattress that you sleep in for roughly 1/3rd of your 24 hour day, the benefits and support offered from investing in in a high end quality ergonomic chair are priceless when one sits for \~1/3rd of their 24 hour day as well.  


You definitely have your eyes on the right stuff. Herman Miller Embody and Aeron, as well as Steelcase Gesture and Leap, are probably the best options available to you right now based on your needs. It is definitely not because of the looks. Unlike the cheap gaming chair knock offs that look cool but are purely a gimmick with no ergonomic support marketed toward young people, Steelcase and Herman Miller both spend Tens of Millions of $$$ per year into research and development into their designs and ergonomic technology. You're not just paying for a brand name you're paying for the amount of effort and work they have put in to create a superior product. They hype is real and there's a reason they have been dominant in the industry for over a decade.  


Whenever I see someone is over 6 ft and are gamers, I like to suggest the Herman Miller collab with Logitech on their Embody chair. Looks super cool with a gaming setup (in my opinion) and also offers great ergonomic support as well as an awesome factory warranty incase you ever have any problems. My buddy who is a 6'5"" programmer and competitive gamer who sits for well over 10 hours a day absolutely loves his and cant stop raving about it.  
Hope this helps you make your decision.

,"Some height adjustable chairs that don't fold their arms go low enough to be comfortable to play guitar on them. Definitely a small subset but some do, like the Haworth Fern (but not the Zody, for instance!).

If you absolutely need ""gettouttadaway""-like functionality, something like the Gesture works wonders but of course it costs an arm and a leg, and it's not mesh (although the Fern is also not cheap and the mesh isn't the most breathable, and is just a mesh back, not the seat).

Less than 500 is going to be tough for any decent ergonomic chair that is new, and it definitely won't have the type of arms you need. I can only recall the Size TO (Air model has mesh seat too) but arms won't go low and I don't think you can get the standard T50 in US anymore while the Air I think was never sold anywhere but S. Korea. The Amia Air only has a mesh backrest, yet arms also won't go low most likely and then again you won't find it for less than 800 so I don't even know why I'm mentioning it, might as we just get a Zody with no arms (or with arms, they're fairly easily removable with a single screw on each)."

You can buy a Steelcase and HM chairs used for 300-400, or you can buy them refurbished for 500-700 ish. The Steelcase v1 is the oldest and cheapest of these, but still a great chair."
,"For around the same price, you can get these  much higher-quality ergonomic chairs that are partially made in California. I guarantee you'd still find their seats comfortable.

1. This [""Bowery Hill"" chair](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bowery-Hill-22-5-Modern-Metal-and-Fabric-Mesh-High-Back-Task-Chair-in-Black/439217586) is a rebranded 9to5 Seating @NCE-216. I confirmed that it is covered by 9to5's 5-year @NCE warranty, despite being about $100 cheaper than the @NCE-216. For the price, I recommend this model because it has really nice adjustable armrests.

3. SitOnIt Wit Home Edition

For the SitOnIt Home Edition chairs, I highly recommend going fully loaded with high back, armrests, and adjustable seat depth."
need help picking a chair,"So far I've tried the secretlab titan evo 2022, steelcase amia, steelcase gesture, Herman Miller aeron and Herman Miller embody. The amia was the only chair that I've thought was decent out of these options. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should try next that's similar to the amia but is more comfortable and has a bit more lumbar support?"
,"If you like the amia, leap would be the next one I would try."
,"In my opinion on steelcase line up it's Leap v2 - Amia - Gesture in that order, the gesture has great arms but the rest just don't do it for me.

With the Leap you give up a little seat padding for better back support, so depends on what's giving you problems"

I got this chair from my moms work more then 10 years ago. It was a good chair but part of it broke and it just kept bending forward.

,"I got mine two years ago, no issues from Amazon. Maybe it‚Äôs the Furngo stock and they got a bad lot from manufacturer. Assembly should require a little bit of effort but not be a Herculean task"
,"We just got one in, had a hard time getting the back aligned all the way (didn't want to push too hard, there was about 1/2 inch that still needed to be slid in).  After we put in the screws and started tightening them, the back pulled down and aligned itself.

Maybe your experience will be the same, but YMMV."

I've only found a reseller here in spain, selling the chair for 2k‚Ç¨, which of course is waaay too expensive.

The other only option is buying an imported second hand chair from eeuu. The chairs seem fine but the shipping + import fees make the chair price skyrocket from 390‚Ç¨ to 1162‚Ç¨ (556‚Ç¨ shipping, 215‚Ç¨ import fees).

Upholstered Haworth Fern in Europe?,"Hey everyone!  
Does anyone know if it's possible to get a Haworth Fern with a digital knit backrest in Europe (Germany)?

"Looking for ergonomic chair for 200-300$, can be less","Initially i was thinking about autonomous ergo chair 2, then i discovered a lot of reviews about   cushion being bad quality, and its very hard, and people said that its hard to sit for longer than hour. Also i discovered that its just rebrand, and found it on alibaba for 130-150$.  


So, i need chair that has soft, or not very hard cushion, and i can sit on it for few hours without discomfort. Need many options as not all chairs would be available in my country, thanks."
,Btodtv on YouTube my guy
,Ikea Markus chair is solid. The cushion is about a medium maybe the back is mesh which is nice because it breathes. I think it‚Äôs around $200.
,local used market! I see Steelcase Leap v2 in that orice range regularly
,"I can only second the Ikea Markus. I have had the Markus for well over 20 years. If it breaks I get a new one from ikea as you get 10 years waranty. I had to replace it once, but mostly was my own fault that it broke I m a big guy and I leaned on one side for years until it broke. I also have the Aeron by Herman Miller a 1500$+ chair, the difference to the 150$ Ikea is very marginal.. The sitting mesh is great in the Aeron and the arm pads are much more flexible, but I almost prefer the taller back of the Ikea Markus... So it's a bargain for me personally."
,"I really like my Ikea Markus at home, if you‚Äôre in the ballpark of 5‚Äô10‚Äù to 6‚Äô1‚Äù I definitely recommend, but if you‚Äôre shorter then that I‚Äôd maybe look at other options. At work I use either a Steelcase leap which is amazing, or sometimes we have to go to another office where they have Herman Miller Sayls which honestly are very uncomfortable to me as a tall person (the top of the chair digs into my shoulder blades). I find my Markus to be in the middle of the two for me, though it does lack in a lot of adjustments and the armrests quite frankly suck compared to either. But honestly as someone who uses high end chairs regularly I really think it‚Äôs a good value for the money. Though I hear the Clatina Mellet is a really good leap knockoff and I constantly see it recommended on the sub, if it‚Äôs even half as comfortable as the actual leap then I recommend."
,I just bought myself a used Steelcase leap v2 for 300 last week. Highly recommend it

,"Depends on what is ""decent money"" to you. I see $140 and I figure I could probably sell for $250-275 after I clean it up real nice. I've never sold a drafting chair though and can't imagine the market for that would be large. It might sit for a while if you do decide to go for it to flip."
Chair Recommendations for a bigger guy with lower back pain?,Let start out with saying I am a larger guy. 6‚Äô3‚Äô‚Äô and about 260lbs. So I think I‚Äôd want something with higher weight capacity. I also have broader shoulders so I‚Äôd prefer a chair that doesn‚Äôt have a frame cutting into my back and shoulders.I‚Äôve had some extensive back pain from office chairs in the past. So I think something with good lumbar support and a high back would be important. I had a Herman Miller Arron at work but I don‚Äôt think it was the right size. Maybe an A or B. I have a standup desk so I won‚Äôt be sitting in the chair for 8 hours. Maybe 3-5 hours per day.My price range is no more than $700. Any recommendations?
,Used Haworth Zody
,This [Sitmatic Goodfit](https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/8934322/Sitmatic-GoodFit-Enhanced-Synchron-High-Back) would be fantastic for you.
,"Closest to furthest: Herman Miller Embody gaming, Steelcase Gesture, Haworth Fern. Traded a fully-loaded Aeron Remastered I found for $400 plus an additional $100 cash for the Logitech Embody, the Fern for $250 used, and Steelcase Gesture for $30. 

Grand total paid = $780. 

Having sat on the Logitech Embody for a day, I like the uniqueness of the seat. It's not super padded, but it's comfortable! Haworth Fern was my current favorite chair because of how comfortable the recline feels. The Gesture has the best build quality of the three, but I feel it doesn't do anything particularly standout from the other two chairs."
,Attach roombas to the bottom and have them fight it out
,Thought I was in r/tressless
,The farthest one looks evil
,Where'd you find these deals? I've been looking on facebook marketplace and craigslist near a major city for months and mostly see v2's for $200 - $400 with the occasional other high end chair for $500+
,I'm not sure if the gesture I bought was messed up but the seat was very hard and hurt my legs. The Fern I've never tried but would love to. Embody hurt my shoulder but the seat was superb.
,"Leap V2 owner, congrats on the haul."
,"Needs an AeronZodyLeap version. Because for many, those 3 chairs are better than these 3 chairs."
,"Awesome collection, but the leap2 is the goat!"
," I had a embody I liked, but after a few years of having It, I wanted to try something new because it was too soft. Currently, I have an Aeron remastered, and I love the chair though I feel like I could never find the sweet spot with the armrest. At work, I have leap V2, and the chair is so good and very comfortable; the armrest fits perfectly with the keyboard positioning. Would you recommend the Gester over the Aeron?"

Very negative experience with 2ndhnd.com,"Felt like writing this because I don't see them discussed much and in the EU there isn't much except them for used chairs.

I bought a refurbished Leap v2 for roughly ‚Ç¨500 + shipping from them on eBay in August. When it arrived, I initially noticed that the gas cylinder was entirely broken and would lower on its own when sitting (which showed they hadn't even tested it). I contacted them and they agreed to send me a working cylinder. It eventually took a few weeks with no tracking as they used a cheap shipping method (when it came, I had just assumed it was lost and had asked them to reship with tracking the same day).

I then noticed the lumbar support was also missing and asked them to ship it as well. This time they used a courier on my request. By the time it arrived I realised my lower thighs were hurting after sitting for a while where the seat edge was. After googling for a while I found out that the chair had a leap V1 seat and thus the seat edge wasn't flexible (it has a lever to manually switch between a few positions, but that didn't help in my case). I asked them to ship me a V2 seat to see if that'd help with the pain and they initially ignored my messages, after I threatened them to leave a negative feedback on chair communities they responded that they were unable to send me a new seat and offered a 50‚Ç¨ refund (which I found pretty shitty considering how the chair was basically unusable for me).

I opened a PayPal claim providing all the evidence and I eventually won and was refunded. I now got a brand new Gesture for a really good price from Amazon and it feels great. I can now tell that the foam they used on the seat is pretty bad compared to the original steelcase one (it feels really hard).

TL;DR their QA and customer service are horrible and they swap chair parts without telling you, despite their prices being pretty high."
,"At least you were able to contact them‚Ä¶ I bought my chair almost 2 weeks ago and they still haven't shipped it, and the contact form on their website is broken

The 2 email addresses I found (contact@theirwebsite and sales@theirwebsite) both didn't have reponses"

,Get both. Sell one u don't like
,Trying to act quick as I believe these are both really solid deals. From everything I‚Äôve see online people seem to be split between these two. Coming from some Chinese clone gaming chair so I‚Äôm sure either of these is going to be a huge upgrade!
,Wow both are great deals indeed. The HM is missing forward tilt and the arms may not move in and out. Find out if they do or don't and that would definitely factor in my decision.
,"If you haven't gotten to try the aeron and know you love it, then the Leap is the safer bet. That being said, that's a great price for a remastered aeron. Good price for both, but I suspect you could even resell the aeron for the same amount if not more if it doesn't suit you."
,Remaster easily
,"Haha. Glad you're enjoying it (I was like wtf that's my room).

Don't dox me.

Truth is I'm moving out this weekend and I'd just bought an Aeron. I didn't want another item in storage to potentially get mouldy anyway.

However, if you want that 15 quid back at any point you can bring it back - tbh with hindsight it would have made a great chair for my garage. Lol"
,Certainly is for a steelcase please with a headrest. Great chair for tall people
,"Looks like 15 British pounds for gaming chair?

It's certainly not overpaid.  

Not one of the brands I focus on, not one of the brands you're going to find a lot of love for over here on this sub but it's certainly a reasonable price to pay for something like that."
Haworth zody,I read this chair is comfortable. Someone is selling it locally used for $230. Is this a good deal?
,"The Zody is undervalued imo but that's just how it be. In like new condition, that's a really good price. In good working condition, that's a fair price."
,"In the UK you can get a Zody a bit cheaper. Only ¬£150 max maybe. People don't know what they are missing, they are fantastic quality chairs."
Haworth Zody - recline issue,"Hey guys,

I picked up a 2nd hand Zody and when I use it, it just reclines all the way back. It doesn't have the butterfly looking lever like i've seen in videos to lock it in place. Is there a way to do this? I find it kind of odd they would release a chair with lumbar support that doesnt really support your back unless it is fully reclined?"
,My 2016 Fern doesn't have tilt lock either. I adjust the tilt tension to stop me in whichever position I want. Sometimes I have to count how many times I turned the knob lol
,You should have a tension adjustment on the side. Look up videos explaining the adjustments
,"yeah I have one and there's a lock. I'm having  adifferent issue with mine where when I hit that lock it still slightly reclines, like it's stuck in that position. if you don't have that lever, it's missing something..."
Recommendations for a shorty that tends to fidget,"Hello all! I've been lurking on this thread for a bit and figured I might as well ask about the thing I've been researching for the last few weeks - what chair(s) might you recommend for a 5'3"", 130lb woman that tends to ""not use chairs correctly."" By that I mean I often find myself bringing a leg up or sitting ""criss-cross style"" while I work, kind of smooshed between the arms of the chair - I know, that's not great to do long term. Does anyone else do this??  
I have this issue in pretty much every chair I use, even the very nice Steelcase ones at my office. When I work from home, I have an adjustable desk which I do use in a standing position when I'm feeling extra fidgety, but I'd like to find something that might accommodate different sitting styles but still be ergonomic.  I'd like to keep it around $500 but may pay more for something. Thank you!"
,"Shorter people who sit like this tend to do so because their desk is too high, particularly if they can't plant their feet firmly on the floor while sitting with their back fully against the backrest. And yes, *many* adjustable desks don't adjust low enough for short people to sit in healthy, fully supported seated posture. If this is the case, using a footrest or keyboard tray may provide more comfort and support than even the best chair on its own. All that said, how high is your desk while you're seated, and how low can it go?

The height of your keyboard and mouse surface also affects chair recommendations, since some office chair seat height ranges skew high while others skew low."
,"So... How do you like it??

Nouhaus chairs any good?,I saw a sale on nouhaus ergotask and ergoflip chairs for under 200. I was wondering if these chairs are decent. If there's a chair for under 200 I'd take some recommendations. I sit at the computer for less then 5 hours a day.
,"I mean they are not on the level of mid or high tier office chairs. They are generally not worth their asking prices new or on sale. 

If you get one on the used market for cheap they're probably fine. 

GamerNexus did a video on cheaper gamer chairs and concluded the Haus ergo 2 was the best of the bad chairs basically. Take that for what you shall."
,"I just bought the Nouhaus drafting chair during the warehouse sale. Regular price I think was $200-something and I got it for $99. I like it so far. Not perfect ‚Äî the seat isn't cushioned, and the adjustments are pretty limited ‚Äî but it's fine for what I paid and certainly better than what I had previously."
Steelcase Series 1 vs Sydiz T50,"Roughly 6'0 tall, 200 pounds. Series 1 on amazon is on sale for $370 and the headrests are an extra $100 which ship later next month. Sydiz has all the adjustability in the seat I want too. I think the depth adjustment is a bit longer than series 1. Also, comes with headrest of course.

My lower back is in desperate need of an upgrade I have a cheap Costco one( true innovations mesh chair ) out of these two which one would you guys pick? experiences appreciated or even other suggestions under $450 but I think these two are definitely among the best at the price point.

,"Both of those are rather petite chairs. 

The [Haworth Soji](https://store.haworth.com/products/soji-qs-mesh-office-chair?) would be a better fit for you and has *at least* as solid build quality as the Steelcase Series 1, as well as significantly nicer armrests. The $446 black and ""blanket fort"" specs are currently quick-ship.

I really like the Strata 1580, from the comfy seat and headrest to the tension-adjustable lumbar support, except for the underwhelming height-adjustable-only armrests. Its warranty is actually a little better than Haworth's (lifetime vs 12 years on everything except 5 years on fabric/foam/mesh)."

,"I'm not familiar with the brand.

Visually, some of the features, combined with the price point make me believe that it's probably not too substantial.

What's throwing my eye is that it's looks like a substantial seat cushion which is uncommon in the lower price point chairs.

I would try it out if there's a way to do that locally, I wouldn't expect it to last a terribly long time but if you like the feel and if it feels substantial, 250 is not crazy for something that looks like this.  

(Just to be clear, this is certainly not one of the ergonomic chairs that we discuss regularly on this sub but it looks passable, at that price point just based on visual cues from the photo)"

Thing I like the most about the Fern so far are the arm rests. The other chair I could never get them far enough back. These position perfectly for me.

Haworth Very Wobbly Arms,"Hi everyone!

I got passed down this Haworth Very from a family member and it's been great! The chair is incredibly comfortable and I've really enjoyed using it. The only issue that I've found is that the height adjustable arms are kind of wobbly and rattle around when in use. Does anyone have any advice? I don't see any obvious ways of taking them apart and I haven't been able to find anything online.

Thanks in advance!"
,"You need to be more specific. Where is the arm wobbling?

Are the arms only wobbling at full extension? What about fully retracted?

It's possible to tighten the fit of the base of the arm to the chair--and this connection frequently comes loose. Just need to turn the chair upside down and tighten the screws underneath the chair that connect to the arm. 

It's much harder to fix an arm that's _only_ wobbly at full extension."

Zody Repair: chair always slightly tilted back,"Got a used Zody for $150 and trying to figure out if it‚Äôs repairable or not. (Does not have the forward tilt feature.)

In its neutral position, the seat is still tilted backwards roughly ten degrees (the armrests are tilted back also).

The chair also tilts back a small bit even with tilt lock on, so I theorize that for some reason the chair can‚Äôt tilt fully forward, so even when I turn the tilt lock ‚Äúon,‚Äù it‚Äôs allowing a little bit of tilt (as turning the tilt lock on when the chair isn‚Äôt fully upright sets the max recline position at that spot).

Any tips on fixing this?

I might take apart the chair to make sure everything is put together properly and there‚Äôs nothing blocking anything, but if anyone knows about any adjustments, let me know."
,My Zody is the same and it just got a new mechanism without forward tilt installed a few months ago. This is by design to discourage users from sitting too upright.
Hyken Flexfit Lock mechanism repairs?,"I bought a used Hyken Flexfit about a week ago and I only now realised that the back rest lock mechanism is partially broken.

The back rest is suppose to stay lock at these 3 levels but mine only stays fully lock for the Far Back one and it stays partially lock for the middle level. The lock for the Straight level is non existant. I've been looking online for a video or something that shows if it's possible to open the bottom of the chair to access the lock mechanism to see what parts needs to be changed but I haven't found anything yet...

Can anyone help me out? I don't have the money to buy a brand new chair and I like that chair so far except for the lock issue."

"Will the Haworth Zody fit tall people? (6' 2"")","I'm looking to buy a Haworth Zody but I'm 187cm( 6' 2"") tall and don't know if the chair would fit me. I'm worried that the plastic top part of the backrest would cause pain to my shoulder blades. I hope someone who's also tall and has or had a Zody can comment on this."
,"For you it should be fine. I wouldn't recommend for anyone much tall taller though.

Edit: I feel the need to walk back my statement. At 6'2"" the Zody is hit or miss. If your torso is disproportionately long, your shoulders will likely hit the top of the backrest frame."
,i am 184 cm and it fits me well
,"I'm 6'2 and while it's comfortable, I wouldn't use it as my daily driver. The plastic top of the frame hits my shoulders, though it is rather flexible and soft plastic so its not a huge bother. Love the seat pan and most everything else about it though."
,I‚Äôm 6 feet 200+ pounds and bought a Mirra and a Zody. The Zody seat pan is awesome but the tilt lock I can‚Äôt figure out. I‚Äôd use this over the Mirra all day.

,"What is your end goal? It's not clear what you plan to do once the ""seat is out"". Depending on what you want to accomplish, we may have different advice for how to go about it.

E.g. if you are replacing the gas cylinder because it won't hold you up ... then we may make suggestions that help to verify that the cylinder is, in fact, the problem. Or ... Suggestions that ruin the cylinder but allow it's removal.

If you want to get the cushion off, then we'll tell you to unbolt it from the base...

But it's not clear what you are ultimately trying to achieve."
,"A rubber mallet is your friend, either that or some piece of wood you put on it using a hammer, however you might hammer it in even worse if you do it wrong, you can also use a pipewrench too try loosen it.

Also if you want to get off the part that has the casters then look under it, there is a clamp on the gas piston that you can bend up with a flat head screwdriver and then pull of so you can dissasemble that part, might even help you with the area on your pic.

,"You could remove the seat, set the cylinder clamp unit on a base so the caster end is pointing down and use a 3/4"" socket to pound it out from the other side,  but that assumes there is access....I use this method for a lot of chairs."
,It's a tapered friction fit. Twist with big pipe wrench is most reliable but it will leave marks on the cylinder. Some times you can hit apart with a soft hammer.  As others have mentioned there are other specialty tools for cylinder removal.

Office Chair - back problems - budget 400/450 euro,"Hello everyone!  
I had 2 back surgery in 2020, had really big problems with it. After a long rehabilitation, I sold the DXRacer (Tier F) and bought a **Sihoo M57** on Amazon for 250‚Ç¨.

I'm about 5'7 tall.  
I'm a developer, when I'm home I use it for 8-9 hours, 3-4 times per week. The more time passes, the harder it feels, both lumbar and seated. The lumbar it's so aggressive and hard, also with poor adjustment. 

In my office I use an **Herman Miller Sayl**, which is way better than this Sihoo. No sort of back pain or muscle pain, It just feels better.   


Now, I was watching some choices, and I found a **Steelcase Leap V1** on **2ndhnd** for 283‚Ç¨ (+120‚Ç¨ shipment here in Italy). To me it seems a really good offer, but I'd prefer to have a wider choice before buying. Can anyone recommend some other chairs to look at?

Get off of it and let it gently back up to full. All motions should be even.  Push back on the back support like you would if you were yawing and really stretching out.  See how if feels from sitting on the lip to pressing all the way back. See if the rear support is really adjustable. Should be good to go from there."

,"Hard to say for sure without looking at it in person and seeing what‚Äôs possible in a DIY sense‚Ä¶ but my guess is that this won‚Äôt work. These cheap chairs are using the 3 point connections on the arms as a way of securing the back and seat. So it seems like the chair is structurally dependent on the way the arm is connected. 

If the chair is just being used for occasional work, it‚Äôs probably fine, but if you‚Äôre using it all day, I‚Äôd upgrade to a nicer chair."

Steelcase Amia upper back lump/defect?,"Just bought an Amia from Amazon and everything about the chair is nice, but the upper back has this lump that has been bothering me. It's about 6 inches down from the top of the chair in the middle. Pressing on it feels like a hard lump.

I ended up taking off the backrest and there is a piece of plastic that goes across it as a shield to the outer shell at the top middle where the problem is. 

The issue is that the plastic piece curves inward at the middle which is the lump I'm experiencing, and is also where a staple is that holds up a thin fabric.

I already started a return process with Amazon, but I'm hesitant to buy another if the plastic shield part is supposed to bend inward or something. Does anyone feel a lump at the upper middle?"

So he f\*\*\*\*ing cemented the hole and screwed a random screw he had '-' ... Thats just hilarious.

I just spent 15 minutes screwing and unscrewing the HM screw in the cemented hole so it would fit the classic screw and im gonna have to buy one off of ebay or smthn lmaooo"
,My aeron is missing one of these altogether... Been sitting on it for a year
,"So i have bought this Herman Miller Aeron for 400 euros and i think it's a huge deal, functionally the chair is great and the comfort is really good.

It has a few scratches on the plastic here and there and the paint on the metal feet is a bit gone but it really doesn't matter.

The only small problem i have is this piece that rattles ... It doesn't rattle when i move or anytime when I'm sitting on the chair, but i think of it everytime and I'm scared it could impact the functionality of the chair. I have tried screwing it back but it doesn't work. Is there any place i could go to get it fixed in Paris ?"
,It's supposed to do that I think Im no mechanical engineer and don't know shit about bolt types. I feel like people have come here for this before and were told it's supposed to do that.
,"OP, maybe take off the one on the other side and try to determine the hex head and thread pitch/diameter. These are generic bolts called button head allen bolts or button head hex bolts. They sell them on ebay and other places, I haven't tried ordering any yet but the thread pattern should be pretty universal except for the one you have in this video.

Try measuring it and ordering a size that should fit. I've also seen people on ebay selling these same bolts for more than 10x the price of regular button head allen bolts by labeling it as Aeron replacement bolts. Possible that the thread pattern is different but I doubt it."
,Looks like you have a Classic Aeron if that helps.
,"The looseness here is 99.9% a psychological issue and only 0.1% an actual structural issue/defect.

----

The part that is ""loose"" has almost 0 structural value to the chair and even if it did, being laterally loose does not have a big impact. 

----

You should try tightening the silver screw, as it's clearly on the verge of falling out, with several exposed threads. If desired, add washers."

need a new chair tired of my secret labs,"I want to go mesh as I get sweaty and I really don't want to spend more than 300( just dropped 500 on an adjustable desk). I'm 5'7 which has been a nightmare with finding chairs that are either too lumbar aggressive, neck support is too high, or the seat cuts into my hamstrings.

I have been using a secret labs chair (I know it's a gaming chair). But it makes my butt and neck hurt from the terrible forward neck support. I'll pretty much try anything I just don't want to drop a ton of money on a chair that isn't made for us shorter folk."
,"Cheap mesh seats (such as the Hyken) are precisely the ones that have the ""seat cutting into the hamstrings"" problem, because the seat mesh starts to sag but the seat frame stays in place. 

Some higher-end all-mesh chairs have seats without a front edge frame, but they're all way beyond your budget. If you're lucky, maybe you could find a Herman Miller Setu or 9to5 Seating Cydia for $300. 

Otherwise, you're better off getting a mesh-back chair with a fabric-on-foam seat, such as the CLATINA Mellet or one of its many clones from [Costway](https://www.target.com/p/costway-executive-office-chair-adjustable-task-chair-w-sliding-seat-3d-armrest/-/A-84718526), [Giantex](https://a.co/d/87QE0hm), [Gymax](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gymax-Executive-Office-Chair-Adjustable-Task-Chair-w-Sliding-Seat-3D-Armrest/405373012), etc. This is one of the best budget office chairs out there atm and happens to be a good fit for your height, unless you're particularly heavy. You may want to remove the lumbar support piece if you find it too strong; luckily that is easy to do.

The WorkPro Momentum is another decent mesh-back office chair with a headrest that would fit you well. It has a unique tension-adjustable ratchet lumbar support mechanism. It sells for $316 at officesupply.com, and you may be able to test it at a local Office Depot store before purchasing."

Would you recommend the headrest on the Haworth Fern for tall people?,"Just curious what the consensus is about the headrest on the Fern since I plan on getting one in the near future. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù (193cm), so tall backs are a must. From what I‚Äôve read though, it appears the headrest is a tad polarizing, and some people really seem to dislike it more than others. 

I‚Äôm curious if anyone near or around 6‚Äô4‚Äù can comment on whether they‚Äôd recommend for or against getting the headrest for this chair?"
,"Mine is scheduled for delivery Monday. I'm 6' and opted for the headrest. I'm a little nervous about it, as I've seen reviews saying that anyone over 5'11"" may not like it.

,"Mine showed up. So far I really like it. Still getting it dialed in though. 

As for the headrest, I would think 6'4"" would be very end if the limit. The headrest moves up and down about 4 inches. I have long torso and shortish legs. I'm 6' even. Not sure the headrest would go high enough for a 6'4"" person. It will be close.

,"Hi, I'm new to looking for a home office chair and I found what looks to be a Steelcase Leap v2 on my local Facebook marketplace? I've never seen a patterned seat like this before so I'm not sure. Can anyone tell if this is legit or if I should steer clear? Or is there something I can ask them to check and tell if it's legit?"
,"thats a leap v2 for sure and seems to have all the options on it except for the headrest, Idk about the upholstery if that's OEM or reupholstered at some point."

Does your back need to get used to a chair?,"So I previously have been using a crappy bucket seat gamer style chair for a good 5+ years.

I recently purchased a second hand Haworth Zody for like $80AUD and after sitting on this chair for a while, my back seems to hurt a bit. Does my back need to get used to it or something?"
,You might need to recline more or a foot stool... Yes your back would have to get used to it.
,"Hello u/jonske

Yes. It has been noticed that switching office chairs requires some time to get used to it. Even with high-end office chairs such as the Aeron, you need to test it for a while before deciding if that chair is good for you. In any case, make sure to test every combination possible (tilt, seat's depth, etc.) to find that sweet spot.

All the best!"

Why do some people prefer Steelcase Amia over the Steelcase Leap v2?,Is it about the seat padding? Tailbone?
,"I almost never see any complaints about the Amia. And not just because it's newer.

The Amia looks better to me.

The Leap is supposed to have better lumbar support, and it is designed to have better lumbar support, but I see people complaining about back pain with the Leap and not with the Amia.

Also, the Amia is $300-$500 cheaper, depending on your options.

If you are a first-time buyer of a high-price ergonomic chair and aren't ready to drop \~$1,500, but \~$1,000 for a chair with decent options is your budget, the Amia makes sense."
,"I think BTODtv did a great job comparing the differences between the two chairs in their [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Athv_LC0Q4A). Essentially, yeah the seat padding and shape are different and Greg (the reviewer) found that the Amia was more comfortable."
,"Every chair is going to be a better fit for some than others.  Amia is a great chair. 

I prefer the V1 Leap to the V2.  Most people like Aeron and I feel like it is unusable after an hour or so.  

Just idiosyncrasy's of the human body and how it reacts to a given place to sit."
,"It's mostly preference, the Leap has more lumbar support, not necessarily better, it's definitely more adjustable tho. We have one of each, I prefer the Leap but my fiance prefers the Amia"
,"Knoll Regeneration is actually a really comfortable chair. I love the back mesh on it, the flexible plastic feels great. The chair is extremely light too and great if you have a carpet. The adjustability is not fantastic but I am extremely impressed by the comfort.

I've sat in everything; virtually every chair by Herman Miller, Steelcase and a few Haworth chairs. Knoll is up there."
,Congrats. Use it well used in good health!
,"As a Fiesta ST owner i cant agree, its no ferrari but a real pocket rocket.
But i get what you wanted to say, congrats on the new chair, looks lot more comfy than my pleaseV2... whoever had the idea of the lil metal steelcase logo on the backrest should sit in it naked back for a month :3"

Steelcase Amia swiveling when i lift my feet up.,"I have a Crandall Remanufactured Steelcase Amia and every time i lift my feet up, the chair starts swiveling on its own as if it‚Äôs unbalanced and is falling to a neutral position.

My floor is perfectly level and the issue occurs on other surfaces as well

I am pretty certain the issue is that the gas cylinder is crooked in the point where it inserts into the base, there is a bigger gap in one side of the hole around the cylinder. I also took a level and placed it on the cylinder and saw that it‚Äôs not level in the spots that I suspected.

I‚Äôve been trying for days to remove the gas cylinder, using a rubber mallet and silicone lubricant, to inspect the base and try to insert something in there but and it‚Äôs EXTREMELY stuck. I don‚Äôt wanna keep hammering the cylinder because I‚Äôm afraid that It will break.

At this point removing the cylinder is not an option and I‚Äôm now looking for other solutions. Is there any way of increasing the friction in the swivel function so it doesn‚Äôt swivel on its own? any other ideas?"
,"Hey there, Dave with Crandall Office here - can you message me some pictures of the interface between the cylinder and base? I'd love to take a closer look and help figure out what's going on there!

- David Crandall - Crandall Office Furniture - https://www.crandalloffice.com/"
,"Some places shim between star base and cylinder to fix cylinder dragging on the floor. There is a thrust bearing inside the cylinder, increasing friction could drastically shorten the life of your cylinder.  Pull up on the star base while hitting the bottom outer rim of the cylinder, do not hit the clip in the bottom center of the cylinder. I find a heavy  steel mini sledge works best.

  
  
  If you still have problems you can remove the clip to split the inner and outside halves of the cylinder. Do this this carefully and upside down, that way you won't disturb the thrust bearing."
,Hi there! We are really sorry that this is happening with your product. We see that Crandall already is aware of this situation but please don't hesitate to contact us if you need further information/ assistance. Thank you!
Teknion Contessa Fabric and Arms,"After months of research trying to find the right chair without breaking the bank, I ended up biting the bullet and getting a Teknion Contessa. It is not the most expensive chair on the market, but it was pretty high up there - $1,100. I chose this chair because I liked that it can be locked in several tilted positions and it wasn't something I was finding everywhere else.

That being said, the fabric of the chair and arm rests are a real setback for me. The fabric is very coarse and itches my legs (I am getting a chair cover for this, but still annoying). 

The other thing is that I find I do not really like the armrests. They can be adjusted by height, but it is not smooth and usually requires me to use both hands to get it just right. They can also be adjusted by width, but again it is not smooth and for me (a small person) they cannot be adjusted inward enough. They do also adjust on a swivel, but that means that I can only get the very front of the arm rests to be as close as I need, which isn't very comfortable.

This is made worse by the fact that the arm rests move with the back of the chair, not the base, so they are usually on a tilt and not level with my arms. 

Overall, I don't think I would get this chair again if given a chance. I wanted it specifically for the tilt locking feature, but I think perhaps it may have been worth it to just go with something else."
,I took the $40 discount for used ‚Äúgrade A‚Äù (or however they put it) cylinder and arm pads and have no regrets.
,"The arm pads unused chair so you should kind of scratched, even if only a little.

A steel case gas cylinder should last for decades, so it just depends how old the chair is.

I would ask u/Ryanatbtod , when you guys list something as grade A, should a user assume the arm pads are close to scratch free?

Ryan, do you recommend that upgrade?"
,"If you want to be earth friendly go used but also if you want new arm pads and a cylinder go ahead, probably wouldn't hurt if you got 40 bones to fliff."
,Think V1
,"think v1, but without arms."
,My thoughts are that it is a thinkv1 leather. It's a nice chair. And personally I find myself moving arms out of the way most of the time. Ask if they'll do like 75 for one.
,It looks like the steelcase think
Are chairs with additional lumbar support helpful or harmful to users with anterior pelvic tilt?,"Obviously, everyone needs some curve, but would opting for the additional lumbar support option on a chair like the Gesture or Fern be detrimental if you suffer from anterior pelvic tilt?

Opinions seem to vary widely. Some recommend that people with APT need as much lumbar support as possible, although this seems counterintuitive. Others, [like this person‚Äôs doctor](https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeChairs/comments/qdqtmk/chair_for_anterior_pelvic_tilt_with_less/) advise against added lumbar support with APT.

I tend to subscribe to the latter view, primarily because pushing the lumbar spine forward seems to be the problem that needs to be corrected. But I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs that simple, and some experts seem to disagree strongly."
,"Most higher end ergo chairs have lumbar support that is more subtle than aggressive. I've felt the Gesture's lumbar support is barely noticeable, but the Fern's is quite pronounced. 

You're going to want a little bit of lumbar support to fill that natural lordosis, but I agree, it'll probably not help with the lumbar musculature if you're having excessive lordosis. Plenty of posterior pelvic tilting exercises would help throughout the work day, I'm sure!"
,"If I were you, I'd look for something with a forward tilt option that also can increase or decrease the amount of lumbar support anteriorly/posteriorly. The fully-loaded Haworth Zody comes to mind and so does the fully-loaded Herman Miller Celle."
Steelcase Gesture vs. Leap: Which to get?,"I've been posting on this subreddit about my Aeron woes. The seat, it's just not comfortable. Like many people say.

So I was recommended by people on here to check out Steelcase. Just went to the store. Loved the Leap and the Gesture. Hard to decide between the two. Anyone have advice?

Leap is a little cheaper but not by much. Leap has more comfortable back in my opinion, whereas the Gesture has a more comfortable seat. Both are highly customizable. Not sure how to decide."
,"You are deciding between two great chairs from the same manufacturer and I think the pros/cons between the two really come down to ones personal preference. I'd just go with your gut and you wont regret it either way.  


My two cents would be that the Leap chair is a great chair, and is mentioned on this subreddit far more than the Gesture is. I assume this is because of the massive used/refurb/reselling community out there and that the Leap is able to be restored and resold at a fraction of their retail price (\~50%). Where as the Gesture refurbs/returns are not as significant of a discount off retail (\~20%?). So those with a tight budget are more likely to gravitate toward a second-hand Leap chair therefore becoming the topic of discussion more often. But if you're looking for something brand new so I wouldn't let any of that sway your decision.  


The Gesture on the other hand is Steelcase's Flagship model. Although the details are very minute, the Gesture is technically more advanced and durable than the Leap chair in terms of build quality and design. When I say minute details I mean if the Leap has a score of 9.5/10 then the Gesture is a 9.6/10. If one really takes the deep dive into every component there is no denying this regardless of what someone prefers in their ideal chair.  


Lastly, my personal opinion is if you do NOT want a headrest, I think the leap is has a slight edge. I am currently sitting in a Gesture w/o headrest and it just feels like part of the chair is missing to me even though I don't prefer headrests on any of my work chairs. Where as the leap I was previously using felt completely natural and normal without its headrest. Again, just my opinion. Hope this helps you make you're decision and find the perfect fit!

Went to a local office shop where they have high end chairs. Sat on the ID Trim by Vitra and it was crazy comfortable.

Cheers."
Aftermarket Headrest for the Haworth Fern?,"Received my new Fern today, very happy with it. Got the Mesh version because Haworth doesn't sell the Digital Knit outside the U.S.

But I do wish there was a headrest. Preferably an aftermarket one that you can clip to the back, instead of the Haworth headrest that requires you to cut into the mesh.

Does anyone have any leads or experience with an aftermarket headrest for the Fern?

Thanks"

Removing Lumbar Support from Steelcase Gesture with Wrapped Back,"**Intro**  
Below are steps to remove the lumbar support of the Steelcase Gesture with one minuscule unnoticeable tear and without breaking any pieces.

**Steps**

1. Remove the back component from the chair [https://youtu.be/GfzrOG-Oogc?t=10](https://youtu.be/GfzrOG-Oogc?t=10)
2. Remove the entire back component from the chair. Do not follow steps beyond timestamp 1:10 [https://youtu.be/GfzrOG-Oogc?t=58](https://youtu.be/GfzrOG-Oogc?t=58)
3. With the back of the chair exposed, pull the lumbar support all the way down, and you should see that there is a black clip that prevents the lumbar from going further down, push the clip down (I used a butter knife for this) and pull the plastic lumbar piece down a bit
4. This is the hardest part. With one hand in the direct center of the lumbar plastic, pull the plastic as far down as possible while keeping in mind the cloth that holds it in at the bottom. Once you've extended it as far down as possible, pull out perpendicularly from the chair to bend the plastic ever so slightly to get it out of the white plastic covering. The key in this step to not breaking the black lumbar plastic is by bringing the black lumbar plastic as low as possible and that your hand is gripped in the center of the plastic lumbar before you bend the black lumbar plastic to remove it from the white plastic.
5. Congrats, you've finished the hardest part in step 4, the rest is easy. There are four ""clips"" that hold the top of the cloth and beside these clips will also have the cloth stapled in. You must choose which side to separate the cloth from the staples. For me, one left side staple was already out, so I separated the cloth from the staples there. I'd recommend leaving the staple in and cutting the tiny piece of the cloth with a scissors to separate it from the staple, less work. **Note: Do not separate the cloth from the outer most staples on either side, only 2 of the 4  inner staple areas.**
6. Remove the lumbar from the chair through the top gap created by the new open area from step 5.
7. Once the lumbar is out, take the 1 or two holes made from the staples and hook them to the preexisting white hooks
8. Re-assemble the back on the chair [https://youtu.be/GfzrOG-Oogc?t=126](https://youtu.be/GfzrOG-Oogc?t=126)

&#x200B;

**Background**  
I, like several other folks I've seen online, have had issues with the lumbar support in the Steelcase Gesture. I've seen a few posts here and there about the removal of the lumbar support in the Steelcase Gesture, though none of them had step by step details on how to remove it without breaking a plastic component of the lumbar support or completely remove the fabric off the back.

After procrastinating awhile due to the possibility of breaking pieces of my chair, I decided to try to remove the lumbar and figured out that you don't have to break the plastic lumbar or severely damage the chair in anyway.

While is my new Leap V1 causing me more discomfort than my dining chair?,"So I just bought a new Leap v1 from Crandall which was a great purchasing experience.  I love the chair's customization, but my thighs and butt (especially) get sore sitting on it after 30 minutes. I have it set up as best as I can to make sure I am seated in an ergonomic position and my feet are supported. On the other hand I can sit in my dining room chair with a laptop for hours and not feel sore.  Could it be that the seat padding is too soft for me and I need a harder seat?"
,"Might not be a suitable chair for your body, but maybe you just need to dial it in a bit.

Take a look at this Leap adjustment guide and see if it helps. I have had to dial in my own chair a lot to make it better, small changes can make a big difference.

https://www.btod.com/blog/how-to-adjust-steelcase-leap-v2-chair/"
,"I had the same thing on both a V1 and V2 leap. I suffered through it for months and finally gave up on them, after an hour or two of sitting my butt and tailbone felt like I‚Äôd been sitting on concrete. I gave both my V1 and V2 to family and they seem to like them 

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2 170 pounds so I don‚Äôt have a lot of butt padding, perhaps that has something to do with it, I don‚Äôt know."
,Give it a week and re-evaluate
,Allsteel Sum... Feels nice. Unique design..
,"I tried this chair yesterday and I thought it was pretty nice, but guy was charging $245."
,"Haworth seem to think so, since their new version of the Zody design is focused on this kind of dual-posture sitting. 

Supposedly it can relieve strain in the lower back. But if you're not having back problems, are there any other compelling reasons why you might want to arrange your setup like this? 

Can you do the same thing in any chair with forward tilt, like the Fern? 

Do any of you with adjustable desks sit like this regularly?"
,"Yes - its called forward tilt - but in that photo the young women is not sitting in the proper position for forward tilt. 

Forward tilt allows you to assume a posture with your back straight up, not leaning onto the chair back. This is very similar to the posture used in a [kneeling chair, or a Balans chair.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneeling_chair)

Ideally you have your feet back, on either side of one of the spider legs, your thighs pointing down, and your back vertical.  

There is a lot of ergonomic research on why this position is good an healthy. Its incorporatio into multi position commercial grade task chairs is a good thing - giving you another option for how you sit, so you can use a variety of positions through the day."
,"After narrowing my decision for a new office chair down to the Steelcase Gesture, I was a bit disappointed to find that very few vendors offer refurbished chairs in Europe, let alone Germany. The only ones I could find were nearly the same price of new chairs. I couldn‚Äôt justify getting a refurbished chair for only 50 or so Euros less than a new one.

  
I first came across buerostuehle-4u.de, which offered the Gesture for 758.08‚Ç¨ when paying with a direct transfer from your bank account. Should you be unsatisfied with the chair for any reason you can cancel the sale/contract for the chair within 14 days (https://www.buerostuehle-4u.de/widerrufsrecht). 

Edit: They will pay everything back,  however as pointed out in a comment below, you will have to pay anywhere between 190-330‚Ç¨ for the shipping. Yikes!

  
I was then recommended to look into buero.object.de by a member of this sub (flxll), which offered the Gesture for 730,55‚Ç¨ supposedly with free returns. Well, the price was definitely 28‚Ç¨ cheaper (also with direct transfers from your bank account), however it seems like you might actually be paying up to 80‚Ç¨ to return items if you were to return something (https://www.buero-object.de/shop-service/widerrufsrecht). 

  
Either way, I wasn‚Äôt too bothered by this and went ahead with the purchase on September 5th. I made the transfer on the same day to the IBAN they provided. On September 9th the order was processed and shipped. In the morning on September 12th, I received an SMS requesting me to choose a delivery date/time. I chose the next day between 10:00-13:00. I ended up getting another SMS the next day at 9:03 AM telling me that the chair would be delivered in the next 60 minutes. At 10:20 or so they rang my bell and brought the chair directly to the front-door. The box is a bit awkward to carry by yourself, but I found that grabbing it by the plastic straps simplified the whole ordeal. The chair is great so far, but anyway the point of this post was mainly to share my experience with those thinking of making a purchase with buero-object.de, so I think I‚Äôll leave it there.

  
Anyway, thanks to flxll for the recommendation. I think if any of you choose to go with buerostuehle-4u.de, you‚Äôll also be satisfied. I ended up initially placing the order with them, but then cancelled mainly due to the 28‚Ç¨ in savings. They answered the phone promptly and were also very kind. My order was also cancelled very quickly after sending them a cancellation request via email."

mixed feelings towards Leap v2,"Final bought used a v2 after hearing lots of positive reviews. The chair is made in Dec 2008, still in very good condition, and is comfortable to seat in. But it just doesn't feel as premium as I have imagined. Tons of flexible plastic parts at places where it should rigid. I've sat in more sturdy chairs in Staples that retails for less than $500. Am I missing the point on the build quality?

Also, the one I got has Steelcase badging in black (and it's not sanded /painted over). Is this a legit Steelcase, or some clone/knock off that I don't know about?"
,Seems to be a common theme here... There are way more expensive chairs out there that do less and arent even comfortable or practical to sit in at a desk.
,"Lots of high end chairs use flexible plastic parts, office chairs *should* move and flex with your body throughout the day, sitting in a static rigid position for hours on end is terrible for your body. 

Do not equate rigidness with quality, especially when it comes to things like backrests. I‚Äôm not sure what else you‚Äôd find to be flimsy besides the backrest (and it‚Äôs designed to be flexible like that) but when I had my leaps they were built like tanks

Post pics but 99.9% chance it‚Äôs not fake if it looks exactly like a Leap V2 and has steelcase branding. High end office chairs aren‚Äôt really faked"

,"Great chair and to be fair, at $50, it's a steal. As long as it swivels and goes up and down, you are good. Give it a proper clean, looks a bit ran through but I personally would go for it. You can also ask the seller what ""working condition"" means."
,So I was looking to buy a used Leap and found these two and they both seem to be listed as V1 leaps but the back design is different. The chair in the first 2 pictures is 175 and the one in the last 2 is 150.

The backrest seems to be missing a piece, or a piece seems to have moved from its place or is broken, that is why it is uneven as pictured.  When you lean back it does not support well as it will lean you further back. Might be fixable but no guarantee




Any ideas on the part that might have broken and how repairable it would be?"

Steelcase Leap V1 thud noise when reclining.,"Had the chair for about 8 years. Tried WD40 made a terrible mess, get rid of the squeaks but not the thud when the chair reaches it's 'end' point when reclining (whatever I set it to) then it makes another thud when I recline forward.

Really don't want to have to buy another chair."
,"Your link isn't working, but I have a.Leap.V1 that made a noise like this. If you take the seat pad off there is a plastic shield that makes a 180‚Å∞ bend and mine was broken where it's supposed to bend. It would catch on something and release right at the end of reclining and spring back. I just removed it entirely with a couple screws."
,"One of my Leap V2s was missing the height lever when I bought it. Eventually I reverse engineered and 3D printed one to replace it. 

The model is freely available on Printables.com [here](https://www.printables.com/model/188529-replacement-lift-actuator-handle-for-steelcase-lea).

,"Here's my experience with Crandall Leap V2. The additional seat foam height was a plus and so was the generous return policy. Although Remanufactured, no noticeable damages on the chair. Quality, build, and warranty of the chair was solid. 

In the end I had to return it. After 3 weeks of testing it i was really sore from sitting on it for a long period of time. Furthermore, the bioknit material i picked got really warm after awhile. The return process was a bit of a pain too. You need to disassemble the chair and return it in the original packaging. For some reason is was really hard to get the gas cylinder out for mine. Thankfully, even though I damaged the cylinder a bit cosmetically, I got a full refund back.

Overall, would recommend crandall if u want to try or know the Leap V2 is for you. My issues are primarily due to the chair not being a good fit for me."

Leap V2 Clicking Sound & Backrest Curve,"Hey Guys,

So I've recently got myself a new Leap V2 and I've noticed that when I return the backrest to a neutral position from leaning back on it, there is a noticeable click sound coming from the chair. The sound is more audible the quicker you return the backrest. Is this normal?

Also, I've found the backrest to have a bit of a concaved or curved shape to it. Does this not push your shoulders forward? Or am I just too short for the chair. I'm 170cm or 5""7' tall.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks."

Please help my butt. The tale of an Aeron guy needing more cushin' for the pushin' (of sitting).,"I have an Aeron remastered Size B with Posture-SL. I like the arms, I like the forward tilt, I like the back, and other settings. What I don't like is how my butt-and-related area feels after a few hours in the chair. My tailbone, upper thights, and butt hurts. This is well recorded in various chair subreddits, a standard experience.

So I have been looking for a new chair. I like the Knoll Remix with the high back, and I also think I would like the Herman Miller Embody. But both don't exactly have the cushiest seat.

Can you recommend something better?

Alternatively, I have been using the Stratta Mesh cushion on my Aeron (until I find a new chair) and it's actually pretty darn comfortable. https://www.alimed.com/stratta-mesh-chair-seat-cushion.html. The problem is that I don't want to rely on a cushion for a chair that is supposed to last me 10-15 years. The cushion will eventually break apart, start to smell, and I am totally dependent on this company still selling them. So I think it's a huge risk to keep my expensive Aeron all because of a $100 (expensive!) cushion. But it is pretty comfortable.

So should I get a different chair? Keep on with the cushion? Sit on a cardboard box? Help, please!"
,Just get a steelcase gesture
,"You need to watch this video: https://youtu.be/LichtcXPSHg

Then buy a steelcase Amia."
,"I literally got a free Aeron over 5 years ago from my friend‚Äôs dad. I was hyped cause I knew how much they cost and I don‚Äôt think the Embody hype started yet so everyone always talked up the Aeron.

I suffer from the same thing where my thighs every night and my butt doesn‚Äôt feel supported at all.

I finally pulled the trigger and got a Fern which should be here on Friday."
,"How about you use the cushion til it wears out, then sell the Aeron and buy a new chair?"
,buy a extra thin silicone butt seat or just use a extra thin regular old chair/couch cushion.  The reason for extra thin is so that it keeps your back pressed against the chair's back and so that the lumbar is set correctly.
,"I had a similar complaint about the Mirra and after getting the C-size Aeron I no I longer have this issue.  I sat in an Embody for 20 minutes in a store and I started to feel in my thighs the edge of the mechanism that extends the front of the seat pan forward. For me, I could tell the Embody would not be comfortable for more than an hour or two.  I also tried a Steelcase Series 2 and it felt really cheap. Some of their higher-end chairs look like they would be a good option, I just don‚Äôt have any showrooms nearby. 

The Aeron feels a bit rickety compared to the Mirra which felt really solid - but it hurt my tailbone and thighs. 

If this helps."

Would a Steelcase Gesture be much better than a Titan Evo 2022?,"I work from home and am looking for a new chair to replace my AKRacing chair I've had for several years. I was younger then and just bought what was comfy at the time without giving it much thought. 

&#x200B;

I probably use the chair about 6-8 hours a day for a combination of work and some light gaming. After doing some research I would've liked to investigate a Herman Miller Aeron, but they're not easy to come by where I live (New Zealand). We only have 1 distributor and they're sold out, the second hand market is next to non-existant. 

&#x200B;

So I think my options are the Steelcase Gesture and the Titan Evo 2022, the Steelcase being about 2x the cost of the Titan Evo ($1600 vs $900). So is it really worth almost double the price or are they similar enough I can go with the Titan? Would there be any other big brands to consider, a lot of alternatives I see recommeneded can't be found in here in NZ so I'm a bit limited."
,"Not difficult at all.  Steelcase is far and away in a different league than anything any of the cheap gaming chair companies make. 

( Looking for a different opinion, check out r/gamingchairs)"
,"I would say yes it is worth getting the gesture over the secretlabs titan evo. The steelcase gesture is better than the titan evo in every way, and it‚Äôs not even close.   The extra $700 is giving you better build quality, comfort, support, and a 12 year warranty. The issue with gaming chairs is that they are based on a race car design, which is not meant for people to sit in multiple hours a day. The ‚Äúsupport‚Äù those chairs provide is almost non existent. Before I got my gesture, I had a Secretlabs Titan 2020. I do not think getting a Secretlabs chair is worth it, as I had to deal with multiple quality control issues within less than a year of using the chair."
,Lol yes
,"Short answer, yes. But the Gesture also isn't guaranteed to be your favorite chair. There are pros and cons to all high end ergonomic chairs, but $900 for the Titan Evo 2022 when chairs such as the Steelcase Amia, the Haworth Zody, among countless others are in the same price range... well the Titan Evo 2022 just doesn't compete. It's branding and marketing that pushes it into that price range, not quality."
,"Yes, it's going to last you longer and be better for your back. I have the steelcase gesture."
MyChair from buychairs.com?,"How's MyChair from [buychairs.com](https://buychairs.com)? Is only for $239, i mean i would want to try if someone have some honest review of it"
,"If you're having health issues, and sitting for 8+ hours a day, I would strongly recommend increasing your budget to buy a high end ergonomic name brand chair if you can afford it. Most authorized retailers also offer affordable financing often with zero interest for a period of time. Your health is priceless and the money you'll save in the long run with a supportive chair that lasts will be far greater than any potential replacements or health related expenses for pain from a cheaper option. I try to view it similarly to investing in a good mattress.

I would suggest looking into the Herman Miller Aeron, or the Steelcase Gesture/Leap chairs if you really want a chair that will take care of you for years.

,"My advice is save your money and purchase a chair that you'll still be satisfied with 6 months from now, 1 year, etc. Trust me, there's nothing like purchasing a cheap chair within your budget, just to find out it doesn't meet your standards. There are several options for discounted, solid chairs on online selling platforms, local marketplaces, or thrift stores."
,"Always remember the age old saying *""you get what you pay for""*.  
With a budget for a new chair that is less than 10% of what most would consider a ""good"" new chair, you should be expecting less than 1/10th of the quality/durability/comfort/lifespan.

If you're that tight on funds I think your best bet would be to patiently browse those sites like OfferUp/FBmarket/CL waiting for someone who doesn't know what they're selling and is offering a used name brand product for cheap.

Leap V2 pain won't go away,"Hi all, I've had my Leap V2 for almost a year now. I really wanted to like it, but even after a year, I occasionally get lower back pain if i sit on it for longer than 2 hours. 

I took out the lumbar band altogther which does help but not by much. I see alot of people associating the lower back/tailbone pain with the lumbar being too stiff in general, but I feel like my issue is exactly opposite of it. 

The back curvature of the chair makes it that my lower back does NOT make any contact with the back support and that's the problem. I feel like while my upper back is leaning against it, my lower back is just not supported at all. 

I set my chair at 2 tick tilt in slightly leaning position with my seat scooted all the way to the back so i m pressed all the way against the back. I find this is the way to minimize the backpain but I still get it. I just hate the idea that my default sitting position is leaning back as I prefer sitting upright. 

If anyone can related to what I am saying above, I would really appreciate it if you could give me some suggestion on a different chair."
,"&#x200B;

Yep that's definitely the problem.

It sounds like you don't recline at all? Sitting upright, while it might be good for your neck posture, is really hard on your back. You'll probably want to recline more and just relax, let the chair do it's job and support you.

Watch this review video where they put Leap V2 as the #1 chair out of 30 chairs: [https://youtu.be/LichtcXPSHg?t=865](https://youtu.be/LichtcXPSHg?t=865) \-> notice how he actually reclines. These are professional chair people - at one point, one guy talks about his most common sitting position which is leaving it in the fully recline mode, with the tension knob turned up a bit. So like a half-recline.

Do you ever just put it in full recline mode with and sit like that?"
,Put the lumbar support piece back in and turn up the lumbar support tension. Removing that piece was literally the opposite of what would help.
,"I've also heard Amia has a less intense lumbar support compared to the Leap V2 but I'm pretty sure the Leap V2 with the lumbar REMOVED is about equal to the Amia... Honestly I don't know how much changing a chair is going to help you with this specific problem, it seems like more of a sitting position issue -> trying to sit upright for long periods of time. It's just physically impossible to support your lumbar spine sitting perfectly upright. That's just gravity. You literally need to have at least SOME degree of recline in order for any chair to support your back.

Best bet is to switch between reclined and upright, every 30mins or something like that. Better yet is to just get up and move your body every 20-30mins."
,"put the lumbar back in.

Press your back into the backrest on the 3rd setting recline.."

New to me Amia. I'm missing my old headrest.,"Partially thanks to this thread I picked up a like new Amia and it's much better than the generic gaming chair I had been using. I do find myself leaning my head back to where I used to have a pillow however. 

There are some old posts here about adding a headrest, has anyone found a solution recently? There is an ""official"" headrest add on but only available from officechairatwork and I know they have less than a stellar reputation here."
,"AFAIK, there is no headrest that steelcase makes for the Amia. So your best option is an aftermarket one.

My main suggestion would be give it some time and see if you end up adjusting and liking not having the headrest. There are pros and cons.

If you do want one, then go grab the one you've found. The Amia is a very sturdy chair and can likely handle modifications."

Stumped on what to buy... (Sihoo M57 vs HM Lino vs Skope TPE vs ?),"Hello good people of Reddit,

&#x200B;

I have been looking for a new ergonomic office chair since my previous chair's metal frame snapped.

So far I've looked at a ton of different reviews of a ton of chairs, most tell you to get a refurbished Aeron, but here in Europe (specifically The Netherlands) there's BARELY any type C Aerons (which I would need, for reference I am 187cm and 115kg) and if there are any, they are incredibly expensive. Like ‚Ç¨1800 minimum expensive. In general refurb/used Herman Miller chairs are quite expensive here, Mirra 1&2 around ‚Ç¨500-600, Embody ‚Ç¨2000+, Cosm ‚Ç¨1000, etc etc. Also Steelcase options are very expensive, the only option I have at around ‚Ç¨500 is the Reply Air which doesn't suit my weight.

My budget is around ‚Ç¨500, and so far I've looked mostly at the Herman Miller Lino (‚Ç¨552 cheapest fully loaded here), the Sihoo M57 (‚Ç¨309 on [Amazon.nl](https://Amazon.nl)), the Skope TPL (which is basically the Autonomous ErgoChair Pro+/Kinn for ‚Ç¨451) and the Herman Miller Sayl (Around ‚Ç¨500 depending on the options).

As previously mentioned I am quite a big guy, I am 187cm/6'1 tall and I weigh 115kg/253lbs. This makes my choices very limited and expensive due to me needing a quality gaslift and a high backrest.

So basically what my question comes down to is, are any of the options I mentioned good for me? And if not what would you guys recommend for me? I would prefer to stay as far under ‚Ç¨500 as possible but I know that's very very hard.

&#x200B;

"Checking out a Haworth Zody for $169 at a local small business, what should I look out for?","Going to check this out: [https://www.cheaperofficesolutions.com/product-page/haworth-zody-task-chair-black](https://www.cheaperofficesolutions.com/product-page/haworth-zody-task-chair-black)

Any initial thoughts based on the picture or what I should be looking out for when I see the chair(s) in person?"
,"Tilt tension, make sure it can tighten enough so you don't fall back"
,Are they 4D arms? Check the plastic lumbar supports as they tend to crack at the corners. Does it have forward tilt (extra tab in front of the crank knob)? Does it go up and down smoothly? Does the crank work to tighten and loosen tension? Is there a lot of dust between the plastic lumbar support and mesh back? Do the wheels move smoothly or are they full of hair/lint?
,Looks like a chair from Staples. The Hyken
,"At the end of the day it's all about choice. As some of the other folks here can attest to, the chairs at the big box stores look attractive and the price is attractive. But if you do any length of seat time, the gas lift will fail or become cranky fairly soon. Also, if it has a pleather type covering, it will start flaking like it got sunburned and the blisters popped. I'm positive somebody can get you a good line on a proper used commercial duty chair. It will save you a lot of grief. But I'll get off my soapbox now because the decision is yours. Maybe take some kind of poll here in the group for options.

looking for a cheap task chair with super flexible back,"Does anyone know of any chairs that are basic office task chair style [like this](https://www.target.com/p/task-chair-black-room-essentials-8482/-/A-14521109) but the back piece can go totally flat or more? 

I had one like this a long time ago - the back was straight but on a hinge so it could flop over totally backwards. It was so nice to stretch out on my back sometimes. Now all the cheap chairs have rigid backs that don't move or tilt hardly at all, or its all solid mesh backs. 

I can't sit like a normal person and these cheap task chairs with the little cushion for the back works for me because I can sometimes kneel on the chair and can hang my feet off the back. 

I've also seen the pipersong, soul seat, and be you chairs so if anyone has tried those I'd love to hear about it. Thanks!"
What is the best office chair for standing desks or ‚Äúactive‚Äù seats?,My birthday is coming up and my girlfriend asked me what I want lol.  I feel uncomfortable sitting for hours no matter the chair so I think I need one of those.
,"Nobody is forcing you sit for hours if you have a sit-stand desk. You can alternate between sitting and standing every 10 minutes if you want. I do that sometimes when my ADD is bad enough lol

But I firmly believe that when you sit at your desk for full-time work, you should be able to relax and have your body properly supported by an ergonomic office chair. Not having that relaxed support is what leads to slouching and other bad postural habits over time."
Help recommend a big and tall chair,"Looking for an all day chair for myself. I'm 6'1 and 350lbs. Right now I'm torn between the Leap and the Gesture, but I'm open to other recommendations."
,"Steelcase Amia but check the width. 
Been through too many chairs that have failed, including the Serta. 

It doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable when first sitting in it, but after 12 hours there‚Äôs no discomfort at all. Reasonable price. I‚Äôm 6,3‚Äù at 300 lbs."
,"Hello, I have actually tried both. I have [this one](http://brflnk.com/leapchair) now and I'm very happy with it. I like the look of Gesture more, but this is just the best chair I have ever had. Like many of us here I had some lower back pain issues and together with some exercise and using this chair, the pain is gone and all this in situation when I'm working pretty much all the time, sometimes 12+ hours a day.."
,"I'm shopping around myself and am a little bigger and taller (6'2, 380lbs).  I used to have a Herman Miller Mirra (12+ years) but I tried out the Mirra 2 and wasn't that satisfied.  That said the Embody had great bucket surface area, even thought the arm rests aren't exactly perfect.  I've found the Aeron a little hard to adjust.  The Embody seems to be easier. 

Right now I'm trying to figure out if I'm going direct through Herman Miller or find a reseller.  

That said, conversations with the rep revealed that they have a 'tested for 350 lbs' that doesn't clarify what that means for the warranty.  He said that it shouldn't be a problem if anything warranty specific comes up. 

Can you tell me what is attractive for the Leap and Gesture?  I'd like to see what other companies are doing."
,I think you will find the leap and gesture not cushioned enough in the seat. I certainly found it uncomfortable and returned it
,"I'm 6'3"" 300+lbs, and I found the Gesture to be much more comfortable than the Leap (the latter was too narrow for me, and I was actually getting pressure from the metal frame into my thighs/butt), to the extent that I bought a Gesture after a week of sitting on a loaner. It's hard to say how I'll feel about it in several years time, especially as compared to other lower-end chairs that may actually cater to large people better (think the Serta you've seen recommended here, or the Office Depot Shaq line), but I wanted to try out something in the high-end ergo space that would hopefully last me more than a couple of years or so.

Here's hoping that I won't just be right back in a Zephyrus in a few months/years, but you never know. Once you get to a certain size, you find that most things just aren't made for you."
,"I have never tried the gesture, but I do have experience with both the leap V1 and V2. If you can find a good remanufactured leap V1 or a V2 with extra cushioning from btod or Crandall, I think they would both make excellent choices. My experience with the V1 is that the cushioning is much thicker, and it definitely holds up over time. The V1 I had was 22 years old and saw plenty of use, but the foam held up after all those years. I'm not sure about the seat width, but off the top of my head the seat pan of the gesture is less than an inch wider than the leap, but someone might have to correct me on that. Honestly, I really enjoyed the V1, I'm about 6'2"" 230lbs and the cushioning on the V1 left me feeling great after 8-10 hours of studying, gaming, watching videos, etc...

As for the Leap V2, I've tried out a number of them, and while the newer, more flexible back is nice, as well as the 4D arms and flexible seat, the lack of cushioning in the seat pan left me with tailbone pain more often than not, and I can't imagine anyone on the heavier side not experiencing discomfort after some time. The added cushioning from the remanufactured models from Crandall and BTOD are supposed to remedy this, but unfortunately I've never been able to try one. 

If money is no object, there is also the Plus version of the Leap which has a wider seat pan and more cushioning, but I've never had to chance to try that one out either, but it might be worth looking into. Now, for the more budget conscious option, and the chair that I now currently use, I cannot recommend the Steelcase Amia enough. The cushioning on the seat pan is significantly thicker than the Leap V2, and I have no problem in using it for 10-12 hours a day, and the live back lumbar is more than sufficient for me, even if it's not as great as the Leap V1 or V2 with their tension controllable lumbar and tilt limiter. The arms are the same 4D arms as the Leap V2 and for less than $700 brand new on Amazon or often less than $100 used on CL/FB Marketplace/OfferUp in my area, I can't recommend the Amia enough, especially as it has a 400lb weight limit. If you have any other questions feel free to ask, but I can confidently recommend both the Leap V1 and Amia."

HM Sayl Uncomfortable or is it me?,"Hello everyone!  I was wondering if I could ask some advice.  For awhile I've been searching for a new office chair for my pc.  I spend a fair amount of time at it, on weekends most of the day and weekdays most of the night.

After weeks of research I felt the Herman Millier Sayl would be my best bet.  People say it is very comfortable (unless you are tall, likely I'm only 5'7) and most importantly it was just about in my price range.  (Actually maybe a bit over but hey!)

So I've been trying it for almost 2 weeks now and it just seems rather uncomfortable.  I believe I'm doing the correct posture and position.  I've researched how to sit, how high the chair should be etc... Even got a footstool to help further.  However, I still do get aches in my back.  But I'm not sure if thats my back using muscles its never used before and the chair is doing what its meant to do or... the chair just isn't for me.

I looked on the internet and found out there is a 'breaking in' period  for ergonomic chairs, that it can take a bit of time to get used.  Now that is all well and good but I'm fast approaching the 14 day return date and as I said I can't afford to spend that amount of money on a chair I will replace because its way to uncomfortable.

So what I'm asking is that if anyone else has had a similar experience to myself in regards to the Sayl or any other ergonomic chair's and what your advice would be?  Whether to stick with it and it will improve or send it back and get another chair.  And if so what chair?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you."
,I generally feel the Sayl is a pretty good chair for shorter people. I'm 6 feet and the chair feels a bit too small on my back but I would have imagined it would have been good. Depending on what chair and how bad your posture was previously it might take a while to adapt and feel comfortable in the chair. I recommend not locking the tilting mechanism and play around with different positions and tension a lot. If it has the lumbar support change that to different places throughout the day and find what feels comfortable gradually. Else you are not taking advantage of any of the ergonomic features if you just leave it as it is

,"I worked for a Herman Miller distributor, got to build and see all kinds of neat stuff, steel case always seemed like a step up. Herman Miller stuff just felt drab. Cool thing though was I did get an aeron b from a place and I've been using that forever. Free too."
,"Can confirm it is a Steelcase Reply Chair for you if still needed. Great deal for only $20. The Reply has been discontinued for a while now. The looseness you speak of is not normal for a new chair, but I would definitely expect it to be more normal on a couple year old used chair.

As for a fix...I cant guarantee it would solve the problem but if its worth the effort to you, the only thing I could think of is that you can request a disassembly guide PDF from Steelcase and try to take it apart and put it back together to make sure all the screws and bolts are in place.  
Good luck to you!

Need help assembling leap V2,"hey, I opened my leap V2 base trying to lube the 2 moving railings on the side of the carrier seat plate, the one marked with number 7/8 on the following image

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4f72maqc7an91.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c1275e9802e5b0f4233d9e1c626dc07e066b949

so once I did that and did lubricate the railings, I had a hard time putting back the seat carrier plate, managed to slide it back in place but the two 1/2"" bolts that used to secure the plate on another plate in the bottom that is attached to the spring, the problem is the bottom plate had moved down just a bit and now the bolts are too short to reach said bottom plate and I am unable to screw them back on to be able to put back the chair, any ideas of how to do it?

&#x200B;

[bolts location is marked in red](https://preview.redd.it/pxr89es18an91.png?width=4608&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e776875fdc309627f09aa480cea55d36fd3bab2)

**Edit here is the solution:** I have since solve the issue and here is a guide on how to put back the Seat carrier plate if you ever take it out and would need to put it back:

1- you would have to purchase a bolt that is same thread size as the original 2 bolts but about 5-10 mm longer (the length doesn't have to be 100% exact, just as its longer than the original and not too long to make your life difficult trying to screw it).

2- you will need to put the longer screw in the right side hole on the carrier plate, look at the above picture to have a reference for the chair/plate orientation to know which one I meant by right side.

3- shine a light under the plate and look there while screwing the longer screw, once it starts to grab on the lower plate, start to screw it in slower, the lower plate will start to get pulled up, pull it enough so that the original screw can be screwed in from the left side hole.

4- once the original screw is in the left side hole and screwed in a bit, you can start taking the longer screw.

5- screw in the second original bolt in the right side hole now, just a bit for now.

6- start screwing each screw left/right a bit at a time and alternating in between the two so that the lower plate rise from both sides equally and the bolt doesn't cross thread in the lower plate.

7- once the bolts are tight, then you are done (the lower plate will be touching the seat carrier plate in the end).

8- you can put back the rest of the chair."
,The plate is fliped if the directions are accurate. Turn it 180.
,See the seat tube? The two rectangular holes on the plate go over it.
,Watch this https://www.crandalloffice.com/blog/how-to-fix-a-creaky-steelcase-leap-chair/
,"I did this once. I think starting longer bolt in one hole then swapping to the correct bolt after starting the second bolt. Using long Allen wrench and/or mini pry bar to help align holes, use one hole on underside of mechanism.   I think having an extra pair of hands would help."
I've tried the gesture - potentially looking for a different chair,"Hello,

Early in the year I bought the Steelcase Gesture chair with lumbar support. This was my first introduction into buying ergonomic office chairs and also before I found this sub reddit, so I didn't know a whole lot. After it arrived I sat down in it and was amazed at how much better it was than my crappy sub $500 chair. Then, a few hours later, I started to get major pain in my tailbone. At first I thought it just needed to be broken in or something but I've been using this chair for a few months now and still have the same problem. I very much like the back rest and arms of the gesture, it feels just right there but I just cannot stand the seat cushion. I'm pretty sure I bottom it out and honestly I can also push my hand down to the bottom of the seat cushion, so it might be a manufacturing defect?

I'm a pretty big guy, 6' 4"" and 300 LBS so finding chairs that hold up are very hard and so far I've been impressed with the durability of the gesture chair.

I've been thinking about getting the Haworth Fern Executive but not entirely sure. Do you guys have any recommendations for someone my size?"
,"My dad is your size. Actually, he‚Äôs only 6‚Äô2 and 275lbs. You say to-mato, I say tom-ato and he has used my Logitech Embody for over a month while I used his Fern and he has no problems sitting on either chairs. The Fern and the Embody are essentially like distant cousins. I used to have a Steelcase series 1 that my company bought me to use for working from home last year and it sucked. After sitting on the chair for over an hour my tailbone would start to hurt a lot to the point I would need to stand up at my desk for an hour before the pain goes away and I can sit down again. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1 and 160lbs and my daily driver is the Logitech Embody. With the Embody I can sit in it 8+hrs per day 7 days a week and not need to ever get up and rest my tailbone. I also used the Fern for a month when I switched with my dad for fun and it was really nice. The seat pan was super thick but it‚Äôs got a seat pan that you need to break in. In the beginning the seat pan is very firm but it gets softer over time. It concerns me because that would mean that the foam in the seat pan wears out in time and will need to be replaced. 

I would think that the Fern would work for you but the Embody would also be something you‚Äôd want to try. Both chairs can support your weight but the Embody uses springs in the seat pan instead of foam so it‚Äôll never breakdown. I think the Fern is very much like the Embody‚Äôs backrest. It moves with you which is super nice."
,"Probably a steelcase leapv2 PLUS, Herman Miller size c, Herman Miller celle fully adjustable with the seat pan and lumbar, Herman Miller embody (maybe)... I have the gesture and it's alright I can see how one would have problems with it."
,"Haworth Fern should handle your height, maybe your weight but I'm not sure. Depends on your build.

But I wouldn't necessarily recommend the executive. I don't think the headrest will come up high enough to avoid your shoulders.

Nightingale CXO6200D is popular for big 'n tall as well, but its seat is up to personal preference. Very plush memory foam, but maybe not super ergonomic.

Imo I don't think the embody will have high enough backrest for your height. But always worth a try."
,There should definitely be something there. Second pic seems to have a Haworth Zody or two. Maybe some Steelcase chairs too. Leap V2 would be good for the Steelcase chairs if they have it. What are they asking for prices?
,I think I see some Haworth and aeron
,"Mostly cheap stuff.  

The one in the middle of the first picture is similar to an office star 5500.  

It's perfectly fine. Nothing special. I would pay 40 or $50 for one and hope it would last for one or two years.

If you're looking at chairs like that in a warehouse, take your time, try out chairs until you find one you like.

Look underneath the chair until you find a manufacturer's mark. If it's a real manufacturer like Herman miller, steelcase, hayworth, technion. .. it's worth about half of what the major refurbers would sell it for.

If it's a name like han, global, office star, boss... It's worth somewhere between $25 and 60 bucks."

I'm a 27y(m), 135lbs Software Engineer. Just before pandemic, I suffered an injury in the lower back from sitting with in my office chair. I had one leg over the other and that generated tremendous amount of pressure on my testicles causing the pain I wished I died from. I couldn't get proper treatment cuz of the pandemic and recently found that I have muscle spasm in the back. My lumbar L1-L4 have issues which causes great pain when I mostly sit on any surface. My pain radiates from lower back to my front inner thighs.

I own a Haworth Soji (in which I suffered my injury) which has extremely firm seat and I can't go a minute without feeling the pain. I tried Herman Miller Aeron and Haworth Zody but had a worse experience that the pai  started to radiate to the back of my thighs to the knees. I got a leap v2 and felt a bit better for a while but this week I developed Sciatica from this chair and my movement has been very limited.

I currently am unable to sit on any surfaces, have pain when lying down and walking. I've never had this much pain before and this is causing me to have real dark thoughts.

I wanna apologize for my life story but I wanted to know if anyone has any suggestions in regards to an office chair with L1-L4 issues.

"BTOD Refurbished Steelcase Leap v2(599$) vs eBay ""Open Box""($370) Steelcase Leap v2","Pretty much the title. After reading BTOD's [pretty extensive refurbishment process](https://www.btod.com/images/products/secondary/sc-leap-v2-10.jpg), I am wondering if it is worth the extra ~200$. 

I ask specifically after doing my own research about specifically because BTOD says they add an additional 1/2 inch of high density foam. The only true issue with the Steelcase Leap v2 is that the seat can be a bit thin/hurt your butt over long periods of sitting. Is that alone worth the extra $$? 

For reference, I am coming from a DX Racer(SHAME SHAME I know lol) but I have never had any issues with my seat feeling too firm or that my butt hurt for long periods of sitting(I have sat in the DX racer for 16 consecutive hours for launch of CB2077). I actually love that I can tilt all the way back and basically sleep in the chair. I have also removed my armrests because they felt too restrictive.

In the future, I would like to maybe use it for hobbyist tinkering like soldering and taking apart small electronic things(like GPUs) - but maybe I would need a different type of chair for those activities."
,Honestly it more depends on the age of the chair. With Levi cohen( Madison seating) it‚Äôs most likely a 2007 mfg date chair. Btod could be selling a 2007 mfg date refurbished chair too but with new parts. It‚Äôs not that great of value either way you throw it unless it‚Äôs a newer aged chair in my opinion. It‚Äôs no wonder btod replaces orginal label with own to hide mfg dates.
,Madison Seating is well known in this subreddit. What they call open box are just used. Some people get great chairs some don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a crap shoot. I would look at a local office furniture liquidator.  Also consider a remanufactured Steelcase Amia or Leap V1 high back from Crandall

What do you guys and girls think about the Knoll Regeneration?,Especially compared to the HM Sail? I don‚Äôt really have the chance to try them out.
,"I've never tried the Herman Miller sayl but I  get the feeling that hm copied Knoll... I love the knoll generation, it allows you to sit all sorts of crazy ass positions. I've been using one in Illinois as an outdoor office patio chair because of the mesh but not today cuz it's raining, left my steelcase thinkv1 outside under a tarp tho in my secret forest office lair. I love this fucking chair. Everyone that has watched me demo and sat in it has loved it. I guess what I like about the knoll is sitting sideways or backwards on it... When I sit backwards on it I put my entire top on it so it's supporting my torso and I draw that way or put my arms on the flex top and flex it down a little with my forearms and I play video games. I got a bad back and don't work for an office chair business so what do I know? üòè"
X-4 and Muuv Thoughts?,My employer has given me some chair options.  Any thoughts on the X-4 and Muuv chairs will be appreciated.
,"I like the design of the Muuv.  They're so goofy looking but in a good way.

However, I used to work for the company that manufactured them (and other chairs).  They were slightly less hellish on the machine operators than other chairs (Herman Miller chairs, for example) so that's always a plus."
,Yes.

I don't know if it would really be my recommendation of someone in that weight range though.
,"I‚Äôm right at 300 and it is a very sturdy chair.  It‚Äôs extremely comfortable in all ways but one. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù and the bottom of the seat back bumps out and hits my tailbone unless I slouch, which makes the seat pan way too short. It caused me to have sores just above my butt. I got an Aeron C which is shaped better, but feels flimsy compared to the Mirra. 

Long story short, that chair should easily hold someone between 300-350."

Best Ergonomic Chair for Neck and Upper Back Support?,"I am starting to feel neck and upper back stiffness after working from home for 2.5 years now. I have decided to invest in a good chair and started to research. Looks like these two currently have good deals for how highly they are rated and both come with neck support:

Steelcase Gesture for $1,360 at Best Buy

Humanscale Freedom Headrest for $1,068 at Dell

Which one would you guys recommend for the price with upper back and neck support being a priority? Are there any other chairs that you would recommend for better upper back and neck comfort?

chair for petite human,"Hi, I am looking for advice on buying a chair.  I did a bunch of research in this topic in this subreddit but still not really sure.

Primarily for computer use, petite human measuring 5'3 - 100lb.

Ok with both refurb and new at long as its reputable merchant.

budget is under $1k but prefer $500 range.

Need a headrest.  But ergo/lumbar support most important.

I've read some advice here, that if you are short (under 5'3) headrest can work against you.

Also others say Gesture has the best OEM headrest but right now it costs $1k refurb.  I am ok with this this if this is the best chair...

Leap V2 doesn't come with a headrest but i like how you can add extra cushion on seat.  some people prefer Leap v1 over V2?

Humanscale freedom w/ headrest seem to be discounted the most, not sure if its a good choice.

fern digital knit might be another choice?

heard some decent thoughts re 9to5 Strata and you get get one for under $500"
,"I work remotely and spent a lot of hours searching for office chairs - the Herman Miller was the most consistent recommendation but when I sat on it I wasn't very convinced (have to get used to the mesh). I was at Ikea one day and decided to sit on all of their chairs and ended up buying the [Gruppspel Gaming Chair from Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/gruppspel-gaming-chair-gunnared-beige-00507589/). I'm loving it (I'm 5'2 and 119 lb)! It has great size for me and the headrest makes it very comfortable, the sit is wide and there are a lot of adjustments you can do (sit, back inclination, armrests). It does not have adjustable lumbar support but the support it has due to its shape is good enough for me. I would recommend looking for places around you where you can try (sit on) whatever chair you feel like buying before you actually do so because it's a very personal choice and what may feel fantastic for someone may not be that much for you."
,"The sense I get about the Gesture (as a 6'3"" 300+lb dude waiting eagerly for his own right now) is that it's maybe not the chair for smaller people."
,"Maybe a refurb Aeron Size A and an Atlas Headrest. It's more towards the upper end of your price range, but I just got a Gesture with a headrest and I agree it might get in the way at your height.

I've sat on Freedom very briefly and I didn't love how upright it kept my head when reckoned, but with how adjustable the back is, the headrest definitely wouldn't get in your way."
,The Strata is great but too large for you unfortunately.
,"The WorkPro Momentum should be a good fit for you, except the seat height may be just a tad high so you may need to use a footrest with it. Some Office Depot stores have it on display."
,"Used Aeron size A classic for ~$300 and then fashion an aftermarket headrest with the remaining budget. Of the chairs mentioned, I believe this is only one catering specifically to a petite frame."
,I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚Äù and I have a refurbished Steelcase Amia from Crandall. I love it! Their return process is great too. I got a Gesture first and it was too big.
Looking for a recline-friendly chair,"Been through several stints of looking for a chair and I've just had no luck finding it despite feeling like it should exist. I rather hate making posts but I'm getting desperate.

My specs: 6'3, bit under 300lb (that I desperately need to lessen). Price isn't that much of a concern as long as I'm not wasting money, though I'm sharply more hesitant as things go 1500+ USD. Return costs are alarming all around, though, and lead straight into wasting money.

What I'm looking for is a mulfifunction mechanism that can do heavy reclines (135+) and has a headrest. At least I'm pretty sure multifunction is the term? Current chair I have and appreciate (timeworn HON Unanimous) has a tilting seat with locking at any position with an attached backrest that also has a separate any-position recline-locking control. Seat tilt is important to me and I'd rather control it myself rather than being pure synchrotilt, as is being able to lock the recline wherever is comfortable rather than a few specific angles

Any kind of bouncy reclining/rocking I would prefer if I can lock and I'm perfectly happy if it isn't there at all. The headrest itself doesn't need to be amazing, just able to support weight while reclined. If I'm leaning back I expect I'm going to have to use a small pillow of some sort for a comfortable angle but I need somewhere to put that. If I'm sitting up I'd rather it was, or could easily be adjusted, reasonably out of the way.

Worst case scenario I could possibly accept syncrotilt if there was at least a way to lock it all wherever I wanted. I really, really don't like tension reclining.

I really don't feel like I have an extreme ask, but either I'm wrong or looking in all the wrong places.

I know there seems to be a lot of hate about reclining and headrests around here but I spend an inordinate amount of time at my computer whether it's WFH, games, or watching movies so I'd like something I can both sit 'properly' at or relax back. I don't have a recliner, or a couch, or even a television, just a computer and an office chair.

At this point I'm about to curse the heavens and order a Titan Evo 2022 and pray... but it worries me so but it seems like 'gaming chairs' are the only thing that fit the features I'm looking for. It also fits right into the issue of 'free' returns still costing a ton if even that fails me.

Also I type way too damn much, but just trying to get points across. Apologies."

Material for DIY chair mat?,"Until recently I was using some laminate flooring on top of my carpet (low-medium pile) and it worked great but I recently got a new charge and to have things adjusted correctly I needed to remove the flooring as it added too much height. Looking for a replacement chair mat but all the plastic ones I've found online (and the one I currently have) dent easily even on low to medium pile carpet and are frustrating.

I'm looking for materials similar to thin plywood that won't raise the height much but will be ridged enough to not dent or crack. Functionally thin plywood would work but I'd rather have somethings that's more aesthetic an don't a bare piece of wood on the floor. I suppose I could cover it with something like this: [https://www.homedepot.ca/product/tarkett-barn-jazz-warm-grey-12-ft-wide-fiberfloor-sheet-vinyl/1001066121](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/tarkett-barn-jazz-warm-grey-12-ft-wide-fiberfloor-sheet-vinyl/1001066121)

Other suggestions?

Edit: This is probably what I could use as the base instead of actual plywood. Due to it's strength and rigidity I think 1/4"" should suffice. Even if it flexes a small amount it shouldn't break and most definitely won't dent, etc. Should give a nice flat, smooth surface to adhere the vinyl flooring too as well.

Best sub $500 chair for a big guy?,"I'm trying to find a good chair for an upcoming wfh job. I'd like something with good ergonomics, but I do like to sit cross legged in my chair sometimes.

I have a *very* small space to work with, maybe 4'x4' including my desk, so I can't have anything bulky.

I've looked into a few steelcase ones but I just can't afford that, even refurbished. I was thinking about the Branch ergonomic, but that seems hit or miss.

I'm 5'-8"" and about 245# right now. At my current job I have this huge Serta chair that I got from Office Depot, but I have horrible posture in it.

Ideally I'd like to test some out in person, but I'm not sure where I can go locally (Indianapolis) that isn't an Office Depot or Staples."
,"I'm not here to pitch you on anything in particular but If you're planning on sitting in it 8+ hours a day I would strongly recommend considering stretching your budget and investing in yourself with a higher end chair. Like ones mattress they sleep in every night, the health benefits from good high quality ergonomics are priceless. I know peoples budgets are tight during these times but most authorized retailers offer affordable financing.  
I don't think you or anyone wants to be buying a new chair every couple years, or have any potential back/neck pains develop in the future. Both of which would be far more expensive in the long run than skimping out on that first chair. I wish you the best of luck finding the perfect fit for you!

Maximize Chair Cylinder Life?,"If the goal is to maximize the lifespan of your office chair gas cylinder...

Is it better to keep the cylinder at the max height or lowest height when not in use?"
,"If you're getting a good chair, the cylinder will last decades, won't make any difference what position it's in.  

If you're getting a cheap chair, the cylinder will be dead in 2 years, also won't make much difference how it's being used."
,"That's a really good question. After much thought, while I should have been working on chairs, I think if it's not in use bring it up to its highest position
Somewhat similar to having a pallet jack or bottle jack supporting a load and leaving it that way. It can probably handle it, but why put undue stress on it.
Another example, if you're carrying something over your head you want to lock your arms that way you're not trying to use your muscles to support the weight also.
For grins in the end I would say go ahead and take it to the bar and take wagers on which one wins"
,"Sorry, sometimes getting information from me is like trying to get a drink of water from a fire hose.
I would recommend having it at its highest point. That way it's not under more pressure to raise. That's what I do with our chairs, especially if it's going to be in long-term storage. Disclaimer: I'm not a pneumatic cylinder engineer, so this is just pure speculation on my part.

fake or badly repaired Aeron?,"Hello, so I went to a shop and found 3 Aeron chairs that all look just like this one in the pictures, when I wanted to check it's size I noticed it didn't have the Herman Miller logo on the back of it or the size dimples either, so I thought maybe there was a period were that wasn't a thing, then I noticed the mesh looks weird too and decided to not bother buying it. so do you guys think this is a fake Aeron?

,"the mesh definitely looks weird, I know HM did some unique mesh patterns back in the day but that mesh just looks lower quality."
,Yeah I'd stay away
,Can't remember ever seeing that mesh.
,"If you drive a BMW, and the windshield breaks, and then you put a Chinese windshield on it instead of a BMW windshield, are you now driving a fake BMW?"
,this looks like the mesh they use on the Chadwick
,how can it be cheaper to ... ad your own cheap mesh... than to simply buy replacement parts?
,"It looks like the mesh was replaced as I've never seen that kind before, but the chair itself looks legitimate. But I would avoid it if that isn't original mesh."
,"Interesting, wrong mesh and no Herman Miller text on the back. 
Very convincing for a replica. Check for label under seat and printing on the inside tilt cover"
,"Can confirm the mesh is definitely aftermarket. The rest appears to be legit but cant confirm 100% based on the pics. After you mentioned there is no labeling I am a lot more skeptical. Could very well be a fake. We have some super old (10+ years) Aeron's and the label is still very clearly visible on all of them.  
If it were any other chair I'd say if the price is right (over 90% off retail) then its not a bad find.  
But Herman Miller spends Tens of Millions of $$$ per year into research and development on their products, their mesh IS different than the competition. I think replacing their mesh on a mostly mesh chair completely ruins the whole purpose of buying an Aeron to begin with. Would be hard pressed to imagine it feeling similar to an authentic whatsoever.

,Can we just start deleting is this fake posts? Clearly the bot ain't working.
,It‚Äôs for sure a real Aeron but they have probably replaced the backrest with a knock off no name from a cheap Chinese company. The Chinese can replicate pretty much about everything. There are no Chinese company‚Äôs that compete with the likes of HM/SC/HW so when you can‚Äôt beat them join them.
Humanscale Freedom with or without headrest?,"So I‚Äôm getting the humanscale freedom chair at my work,  and I‚Äôm debating between getting one with or without a headrest. It will be for working from home, mostly for task work. 

 I did try both and I liked the freedom without the head rest, but I could see a use for the headrest later in the day for more relaxed work. I have heard people complain about the recline and while I agree it feels awkward, if you don‚Äôt push too far back then it is quite comfortable in recline for me.

I was wondering if anyone has used this chair more long term and could share their experience?"
,">I did try both and I liked the freedom without the head rest,

Rare breed! We work very closely with Humanscale and I have to say the Freedom with Headrest is significantly far more popular than without. A lot of critics claim the Freedom chair isn't even worth getting without the headrest.

I think the whole headrest debate really comes down to personal preference. I myself think the Freedom without is perfectly fine and comfortable, but I never lean back and try to relax in my chairs. If you like to kick back and lounge, you may need it. If you're going to be in work mode then you probably wouldn't even notice it wasn't there.

PS, the Freedom is their flagship model, but I have to say I've been digging their new Path chair and we have gotten nothing but good feedback on it so far. Also incredibly environmentally conscious and sustainable if you're into that sorta thing. Maybe worth looking into if you decide against the headrest, lots of info about it on their website.

,"Freedom with Headrest is my main work chair. I also own 4 Aerons, so that tells you something. The only reason I can see not getting the headrest version is if you want a true task chair with lots of mobility, never needing to recline or rest during computer breaks."
,"Update: I ordered the freedom with the headrest, won‚Äôt be in for another month probably but I‚Äôd be happy to share my feedback once I spend some more time in it."

,"I don't think it's a ID Mesh, at least I don't think they have a lumbar adjustment on the right side like that, and the back tensioner located on the left side is further forward...but if it's not then $20 for a chair of any kind in as good of shape as this one is still a good deal."
Chair recommendation below ‚Ç¨500,"Hey, I'm 17 looking for a proper chair so I still have my back to depend on when I grow up.

I am \~180-182 cm and about 95 kg (fat i know)

Can be used, refurb or new, just something comfortable that'll get me to sit correctly for 8+ hours a day while gaming.

Needs to be available within EU."
Tips on steelcase gesture setting,"My new gesture is an awesome chair and feels very good sitting in it. However, I feel like the setting between the most upright and the first recline setting to be a very large jump. I would love one lockin setting inbetween.

I sometimes sit completely upright but most of the time want to recline back just a bit. But the first recline stage is just too far back.

Do you guys have any recommendations? Am I doing something wrong here?"
,"One thought.  Set it to the first recline setting, but set the force required to make it recline higher until it stops where you want it while in your normal seating postion."
Buying Aeron Remastered from Madison Seating through Ebay?,"I know Madison Seating has a bad rep here for being a bit shady, i.e. claiming refurbished products as open-box. And while I don't want to condone that, it does seem like buying through their Ebay page has some benefits:

\- The Remastered only came out a few years ago, so more likely to just be a used product

\- The return policy is backed by Ebay so it's harder for them to be difficult about it

\- They have really good Ebay reviews (99.9% positive 6000+, unless you can game this somehow?)

\- Should ship much faster according to dates listed

So now I am leaning this route over a refurbished Aeron classic from a more reputable refurbishing site. Am I crazy / missing some important detail here?"
,"I am the outlier on this sub who has worked with Madison and purchased from them to mostly all good experience.   

When I need Aeron to be close to perfect for a fussy client, I get it from MS. (Just like if I need a perfect Leap, I call Crandall)

The DTC business is tough.  All the refurbers got hit hard at the start of covid when they couldn't turn product fast enough for everyone that needed a chair.  And people who write reviews for D2C are more often unhappy than happy.  (If you sell 100 chairs and 96 of them go out perfect and four of them go out with problems, you're likely to get three positive reviews and three negative)

If you do buy from Madison, or anyone else, please let us all know how it goes."
,Have u considered BTOD.com?
,"You‚Äôre 100% correct that you‚Äôre protected by eBay IF there was something wrong with the chair that MS did not disclose. They use the same photo for all the chairs that they sell on eBay so you never know what you‚Äôre going to get. You‚Äôre not protected if you have ‚Äúbuyers remorse‚Äù and if you want to return the chair you‚Äôll have to take the chair apart and put it into the box, put it into your car, and pay for return shipping. That is a lot of hassle just to save what? $300? I‚Äôd rather buy a chair from Crandall Office Furniture or BTOD. At least they have a fully refund policy and a warranty on the chair. 

I would stay away from it but roll the dice if you like."
,Don‚Äôt buy from them they sold me a chair that had a broken gas cylinder and wanted me to ship it back which cost as much as the chair. I ended up contacting https://www.crandalloffice.com which I bought a new chair and told them about my experience with Madison. They wanted me to send them pictures of the broken chair and helped me find out what was wrong and sold me the parts at a fraction of the price it would have been to go through Maddison and instructions to fix it.
,"did you end up buying? I bought one on eBay a few days ago, but they haven't shipped yet. I'm getting a bit sketched out now, and I can't even cancel the order. 

I won't really care if I need to clean it up a bit, but I'm just hoping it's not broken or anything"

My Herman Miller clone of the Eames Aluminum chair,"I bought this chair from Laura Davidson early in the pandemic ($300 or so) and thought I'd throw out my recommendation for it. It's fairly comfortable, but I tend to sit with my legs up in the chair while working. The fake(?) leather is surprisingly durable and is completely unscuffed.

The only problem I had was the little plastic spacer had cracked between the arms and the chair body. I contacted the company and they apparently had replaced the part with a metal one and sent me a new hardware pack free of charge.

,">The fake(?) leather is surprisingly durable

For $300, its undoubtably fake leather, but there's nothing wrong with that! The ironic part is real natural leather wears down noticeably a lot quicker than fake leathers. Main culprit is the oils in our skin and heat.

Couldn't tell you how many customers buy the premium most expensive top grain leather upholstery packages and come back complaining that there are stains/cracking conveniently where their head/rear-end lay after a year.

Glad to hear Laura Davidson took care of you after you had a problem and that you're enjoying your clone! Rare that these more affordable options come with good customer support.

,"I like u/HorseFucked2Death suggestion of asking the insurance company to help you get something better. I'd hate to be the bearer of bad news, but a ""really good chair"" will run you at least 4 figures (if brand new).

You will be able to find some decent used/knock-off options within your budget. But I would recommend asking yourself what makes more sense. Spending say $1000 on a brand new forever chair with 12-25 year manufacturer warranty from a reputable brand to cover any problems. Or spending $300 on the best you can get now, just to spend another $300 every couple years on a replacement.

I know most peoples budgets are very tight right now, but please keep in mind your health is priceless. If you truly have chronic backpain I would strongly suggest you invest in a high quality ergonomic chair that will last a lifetime if you plan to spend such a significant chunk of each day sitting in it. Same can be said about a high quality mattress, you'd be amazed by the long lasting health benefits just sleeping better will make on daily aches & pains.

Haworth Soji Questions,"Hi!

I'm thinking of purchasing the Haworth Quick Ship Soji Mesh Chair. I'm 5' 4.5"" and 120-125 pounds with no major back problems that I know of. I haven't had experience with ergonomic chairs before and it's difficult to find places to try out different models in NYC. Would I be missing much if I don't go for the standard version with lumbar support, forward tilt, and an aluminum base? 

If you have other chair suggestions that are below $500, I would be open to them. I was thinking of getting the Workpro 9000 when it was on sale. I know Steelcase and Herman Miller are usually recommended, but I would rather not spend too much on my first ergonomic chair. I'm also not comfortable with purchasing refurbished chairs. Thanks! :)"
,"Definitely get the lumbar support. The Soji is designed to have it. It's not particularly strong, if that's your concern.

The aluminum base simply makes the chair appear and feel more premium, but it is not any more functional than the nylon base. It is on you to decide how much that premium feel is worth to you.

I'd say forward tilt is the least necessary add-on if you don't think you need it. Don't pay extra for it, but no need to avoid it if it's free."

"Steelcase gesture issues (arm rest, squeaking)","I've bought a used Steelcase gesture and discovered the following issues:  


1. Arm rest height. The height levels themselves are uneven by about 0.6cm to 0.8cm, meaning I am unable to get them to the same height.
2. The lower back mechanism for tilting the back rest is squaking/creaking. I tried oil, but that hasn't helped so far.

Any suggestions on how to fix these 2 issues?"
,".6cm is less than 1/4 inch how are you measuring?  Try putting the chair on a very level surface, then put a level across the arm caps. Your dominate arm is usually slightly longer than your other arm, I doubt steelcase designs for that. If the difference is consistent, in different positions, you could use something to shim up the armcap.  
  
Grease works better than oil.  Identifying the source of the  noise can be tricky."

Optimizing Aeron for height,"Hi, I have a used Aeron B. I'm 6' tall, 185lbs. I can't seem to get it comfortable for me. I used to think the chair just wasn't able to go high enough, but it turns out that according to the calculator, the dimensions of my entire workspace are ok: [https://www.omnicalculator.com/everyday-life/desk-height](https://www.omnicalculator.com/everyday-life/desk-height)

I feel two things are off. One is that if I set up my armrest to be level with the desk, my shoulders are pushed up. I think the bigger issue though is that much of the back of the chair arches backward so I do not feel like I have support to keep my back straight. 

Another thing is that the chair seems to dip down and back when I sit in it. I wonder if this is an indicator that something is wrong.

Do you have any advice for how to set up or whether there are add ons to make this work?

As an aside, I did order the Haworth Fern for my home so maybe I should just sell this one. But I am curious because the Aeron seems to come up in convos about chairs for tall people. Thanks!"
,Tighten your tension. I would also watch some of their youtube videos. Herman Miller's ergonomic theory is a little weird and I never got into it as it does involve the chair tilting back.
,Actually no need armrest while working or typing keyboard. Imagine a pianist. Just set armrest to lowest setting.
,Addendum: the chair also wobbles front/back and side to side about 5-10 degrees

Is it normal for an office chair to sink immediately after sitting on it?,"Hello.

I bought an office chair for 300 bucks a few days ago. The problem here is that, after some time of not using it, the chair would sink right when you sit on it. That doesn't happen when you sit on it a few seconds after not doing so. It sinks immediately, and it doesn't sink while I'm sitting on it.

Thanks in advance!"
,Sinking like a 1/2 inch immediately then springs back when you stand up is normal.

**NEEDS**

Seat Depth -17""

Seat height from floor to seat - 16.5""

Ergonomic - bad back issues

Flip up arms (partial need, depending on height of arms- need to go under my work space.)

**Desires** \-

REALLY REALLY WANT-Thick Cushion vs mesh - more executive style

Prefer Executive style, however as long as it is cushiony I'm okay with that

Prefer one with color options (not wanting brown or black, would love grey or white)

I am hoping to find somewhere local (Bay Area, CA) that I can actually try it out vs ordering online and then having to return, but if I have to order online then must be someplace with a good return policy.  I have found this chair online, but hoping for something local - if not I might order this one and see what happens worst case scenario.

Hoping someone here either has a chair like this or has knowledge of one to help steer me in the correct direction."
,">Ergonomic - bad back issues

A cushy chair won't help with your back pain. You'll be way more comfortable in a chair that provides good back support (after a few weeks of adjusting to healthy seated posture).

I recommend the Friant Ignite. $330 on Wayfair if you use a free Wayfair Professional account (and free returns within 30 days!). The Ignite's seat adjusts lower and shallower than its official dimensions of 17"" minimum seat height and depth. It feels well-made, provides great back support, and has highly-adjustable armrests that should fit under your desk with ease.

,[Better Source Liquidators](https://www.abettersource.com/furniture/used-task-conference-seating/) in the Bay Area appears to have a great selection of fairly priced used mid-tier to high-end office chairs you can try.
,"Thanks for the replies.  What I meant by a cushy chair was a seat that had a thicker cushion as I get uncomfortable for long periods of time with no cushion to thin cushions.  I also was not clear, I have back pain from sitting too long in a chair that just doesn't fit me.  I do not work for a company, so I don't need to sit everyday day in and day out.  I support my husbands two businesses and I also run an Etsy shop so some days I'm not sitting many hours and other days it's all day.

I ended up buying a chair that I will use until I can find the ""perfect for me"" chair.  Bought the Sorina at Staples  (and bought a memory foam cushion for lumbar support).  it isn't the most cushy chair but has enough for now and it has the flip up arms which I really like.

Wow, this is the first chair that I have sat in that actually fits me!  That is very sad considering I'm 60! I can actually reach the ground and feel the back of the chair so my back is not slouched after a few hours.  With the cushion it immediately felt ""right"" and I do sit correctly.  Without the cushion the first day was good, barely any soreness after 6 hours, but the second day with the cushion, zero pain after 8 hours (it's been 3 days now, so I'm VERY happy. I do want a better chair that truly has ergonomic support so this is just temporary, but this definitely lets me know I'm am on the right track with getting a truly good fit and lumbar support.

Now, I just need to get my DH to fix my desk so it is lower so everything is at the correct height!  He is a general Contractor and he put a long piece of wood with veneer along the entire length of well in the bedroom but it's way too high for me, or I need to find a food cushion and raise the chair...we shall see.  Onward on my journey to an ache free back!

Follow up: Embody Aeron Leap v2 trial,"So I recently was able to test all 3 chairs and came to a short conclusion, price doesn‚Äôt matter when it comes to comfort. All chairs were fully loaded, the cheapest one was the winner. I tried really hard to like the HMs since I didn‚Äôt want to go sell them.

About 175cm or 5‚Äô10‚Äù, average fit gym bro. 70% work and 30% gaming

Aeron, works well very adjustable but it‚Äôs very polarizing. You‚Äôll hate if you slouch since the rim will punish your legs or you‚Äôll love it because it‚Äôs so comfortable and breathable.

Embody, the seat pan is very comfortable and fits a wide variety of seating positions. BUT, the back fit and pixelated back can be felt if not seating properly. The backfit is a pain to adjust, it‚Äôs not the same like the Aeron. I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve got it properly adjusted after 3 months of use. I may end up keeping it since a headrest is being manufactured. The only redeeming factor of the backfit is that it forced me to take breaks every hour or so due to back and neck pain.

Leap V2, doesn‚Äôt win any beauty contests but it‚Äôs the most comfortable by far. You can seat slouched or straight and it will adjust to what you want. The arms are so adjustable and the lumbar support is so well padded. I can‚Äôt think of anything bad about it other than that the recline mechanism isn‚Äôt as good as the embody.

I ended up keeping the embody and the leap v2, if the embody still causes forward head posture due to lack of headrest I will have to sell it and get another leap v2 or a gesture.

,">I can‚Äôt think of anything bad about it other than that the recline mechanism isn‚Äôt as good as the embody.

funny, cause I think the recline mechanism is the only good thing on the leap v2 that I REALLY like. It lets you recline without raising the arm rests just like the seat. You can still have your arms on the armrests and your table cause they are still on the same level while reclining. Reclining in this chair is pretty much the exact position you would get if you slouch and especially while gaming.. you can keep doing that but with a straight back. I think that's genius. I' personally have never really understood the rocking thing. I would only rock in a chair if I'm not really doing something on my computer and not have my arms on the table. Especially while gaming I wouldn't want the chair to move at all. Either straight or a locked reclined position. If I sit at the desk and really do something, I don't need this rocking feature. It's pointless and even a worse feature in my eyes when you can't lock it at a certain angle. If I need breaks and movement, I stand up.

I have also tested the leap and embody (sadly not the aeron) for a few weeeks, now I'm on the leap v2 for almost a week.. but I can't really seem to adjust and like the whole backrest thing thats going on with the leap v2. I find the design so absurd and counterproductive. It's designed to move when you lean into the lumbar (and yes also flexible at the top). If you lean into the lumbar, then the upper part of the backrest (which is so much leaned/tilted back), finally comes a little towards your shoulders but... not enough. Never really enough. It never really feels like I sit against the whole backrest of the leap v2 but only against 1/3 or 2/3 of it and mostly the lumbar, even when I lean into it with weight (already tried to remove the lumbar). The leap v2 feels too much tilted backwards that I have to actually lean back in it to get a fully straight posture, also with my upper body. This also made me realize how bad the headrest on this chair is, fuck me. It's really just in the way, because you also have to lean back with your head but pushing your head against the headrest also moves the flexible top part of the backrest for the shoulders  even further back.. like what? I just can't really sit fully up straight like I can on the embody. On the embody I could adjust the back to make the upper part for the shoulder come more forward, just so slightly to atleast have light contact with my shoulders. This made it easy to at least sit really straight without noticing. it really felt effortless because of that contact on the shoulder blades. On the leap v2 on the other hand, my shoulders have no contact and it makes me roll them forward and even get into a forward neck position if i try not to lean back but just sit straight. Weird design. Made to be flexible and all but it doesn't really work. At least not for me. When I push at the bottom lumbar part it doesn't move in enough, and when I push against the headrest it pushes the backrest even further back, away from my shoulders. I think the huge gap between the seat and backrest is also what makes this whole flexible and moveable backrest worse and not really better.

The thing that I figured out with the leap v2 for me is, when I sit in it and press down these 2 ""arms"" right behind my butt on the right and left that are attached to the backrest (to give it this movement), If I press these down at the same time with my two thumbs and quite a bit of force, while sitting down, the whole backrest comes way more towards you and finally feels more straight and way way more comfortable while still having these ergo curves of the backrest. I think the chair would be much better like that. I already thought about if I could somehow make this mechanism thing on the sides softer or anything but I don't know if anyone ever figured something out to do that and I'm also still within the 30days to return it so i can't really try things. But maybe I'm also just too light for this chair and need more weight that pressed more into the lumbar.. I don't know.

&#x200B;

Edit:

>""if the embody still causes forward head posture due to lack of headrest""

after I tried these 2 as well I can say, a forward head posture doesn't come from not having a headrest but from a bad posture (I always was a headrest guy). Especially from the upper body and shoulder area. When I found the right setting on the embody (had a mirror on the side of me to always check my posture) I really haven't missed a backrest and that was enlightening. I only wish the overall backrest of the embody wasn't as hard after some time and had a bit more foam in it, also over the lumbar section. I would instantly take the embody."

If you're worried about scratching it while removing it, you can get a strap wrench, wrap it tight around the piston, flip the chair over and give the wrench a few good taps with the hammer.

Authentic steelcase leap plis?,Is the above chair authentic or does it seem a bit shady? Thanks
,Steelcase does make a Leap Plus. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking.
,Looks like a v1 likely 20 years old.
,It's a first gen leap... Yes they made a plus model with a wider seat pan and a stronger piston.  A bit expensive for a used leap 1 since it's a 20 year old chair at this point.
,"It's certainly a real leap version 1.

From the photos I can't see an indication that it's a plus but that also doesn't mean it's not one."
,Leap v1 300 is a lot
,Steelcase Leap V1. And an old one at that. I think $300 is quite high for one.

Herman Miller Sayl (fabric back) for 6'2 250lb male?,"I've been searching for a relatively affordable good ergonomic chair to replace my waste of material gaming chair for a bit now, and came across a Herman Miller Sayl with a fabric back for 300 euros.

But looking at the chair I'm wondering, would it be comfortable for a 187cm 250lb lad like me? I'm seeing mixed responses mostly but I'm wondering what you guys think.

&#x200B;

Please also do leave recommendations if you may have any, I'm based in Europe and my max. budget is around 300-400 euros."
,"Back is too short on the Sayl and I'm 6'00"". You would probably find the Mirra or Celle better."
,"Interstuhl might have options for you, I often recommend the Fern to taller people.

Sayl is too short for 5'11 and above imo.

At your budget your best odds are in the used market, or looking at smaller name brands. There are some good options out there but smaller brands don't always supply to Europe."

New chair question,"So I recently got a Gesture from Crandall, and I guess what I'm wondering is if I like it? I've been sitting in some crappy Costco chair for the past 2 years, and the Gestures back compared to this really pushes my lower back forward. Is this just lumbar support? My back seems to hurt / click less after sitting in it, but it also feels mildy fatiguing if I spin the tension knob enough. 

Not super sure what I am feeling, my main question to ask is what criteria is there for liking a chair? Of I definitely like it, but I'm not sure if a different one would be better or if I like it $1100 worth."
,You are just going to have to figure out how much lumbar support is the right compromise for you.  It may be that there are other chairs where the lumbar works better for your back.
,"https://youtu.be/QV2QOE7Dq60

Watch this video and don't be afraid to play around with the settings. Also give the chair about 2 weeks not only to find your settings, but for your body to adjust.

But if your body feels uncomfortable in certain situations like when you crank the tension way forward, then simply don't do that. High end chairs give a range of options so people can explore and find how it fits them best. Make the chair fit you, don't force yourself to fit the chair. Follow your comfort, while also using the video I showed above as guidance.

No chair will feel like sitting on a cloud. Don't expect magic from them. The best thing you can do for your body/back is exercise and take frequent breaks as well. It may be it's not the right chair for you and that another high end one suits you better, and there are complaints about aspects of the gesture but no chair is free of complaints by some portion of people. If after a few weeks it doesn't work for you, it may be time to try some more."

You could buy the Wit without armrests, but you may as well get them since they're only $20 extra and easy to uninstall if necessary.

"Any way to mod Leap V2 to make it recline further? If not, anyone have good alternatives?","Been using a Leap V2 for 5+ years now. I find myself constantly having my feet up on my desk, reclining as much as I possibly could. This puts a lot of pressure on my lower back which is now starting to ache a bit. Another redditor posted an image/diagram. [This](https://preview.redd.it/ly9501ibu1h81.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=87fa206e66add0e085e0751af6cf75fb992f11ea) is what it looks like lol 

I find myself wanting naturally wanting two things:

1. Foot rest
2. 130+ angle recline

Is there any way to mod the LeapV2 to get #2? If not, does anyone have any good recommendations for ergonomic chairs with good recline + footrest? I came across this [random](https://www.amazon.com/SAMOFU-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Breathable-Relaxation/dp/B08R64L9W9) one on Amazon (SAMOFU). It has decent adjust-ability but the quality of it definitely looks much cheaper and a step down from the V2. Another one I saw was Odlinlake and Autonomous."
,Better to just buy a footrest / footstool.
,"If you take off the seat you can look at the mechanism and I believe it's a rubber wedge that limits the recline.

It's been a while since I looked inside a Leap, so details are fuzzy."
,"v2 w/ headrest here, for 12 years now.  I think you need to ask yourself why it is that you need to get your feet up so high.  The chair is definitely not designed to support that much recline, and reclining that far may cause your center of gravity to leave the support polygon of the base.

I was able to significantly increase my comfort when reclining by using an ottoman for a sofa under my desk and putting my seat to the lowest position.  This allows me to keep my back in the supported position, but still achieve the leg traction that I wanted.  My feet are touching the bottom of my desk surface, so it's fairly high.

I suggest trying something adjustable, like an upside down trash can with books on it, to figure out at what point additional foot elevation reaches diminishing returns.  I suggest you use a stopwatch and time how long you are able to sustain your reclined position, versus how long you are able to sustain an upright seated position.  I suspect it's far less time than the upright position, and very unhealthy from a spinal health perspective.  A good recline should be almost infinitely sustainable."

Steelcase Leap V2 Arm Stuck,"I just bought a used Steelcase Leap V2 and everything is great except for the right arm. The pivot, width, and depth all work fine, even the button can be pressed in without issue, but the arm height remains stuck at the lowest position. Is there any simple fix for this?

Tilt Tension on New Chair requires leg muscles on loose setting.,"At first I bought this chair off Amazon [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874CGKST?psc=1&ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874CGKST?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)

My biggest issue with it is it wants to fight me when I want to recline. On the furthest rotation of the tension knob, the chair still want to spring upright and it takes too much effort to comfortably recline and it's very noisy. The seller offered to send a new mechanism but in the end I got a partial refund since it was a real hassle to send it back (I just wanted a refund and to send it back. They were very generous). My intention was to get another chair and either sell or give this chair away.

I ordered another chair from Home Depot [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Vinsetto-27-25-x-30-x-47-75-Grey-PU-Leather-Swivel-Executive-Chair-with-Arms-920-063V80/316621206](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Vinsetto-27-25-x-30-x-47-75-Grey-PU-Leather-Swivel-Executive-Chair-with-Arms-920-063V80/316621206)  that had a much better recline experience out the box. Little to no effort to recline. But the seat was too hard and narrow for my taste so took that one back to the store. Then I went to Staples and got another chair based on the sitting experience of the model in the store and when I got it home, it was nothing like in the store. It's the same stiff recline experience I'm having with the first one so I took it back and figured I might as well try and make the first chair work for me somehow.

I'm wondering if reclining in a brand new chair is supposed to be easy? The second chair I bought says yes. My wife have an old medium back chair that reclines effortlessly. I'm having a hard time gauging how to deal with this because it's not much info on how the tension is supposed to behave out the box and how to deal with it beyond turning the knob. I know I can buy a replacement mechanism, but before I spend anymore money, I just want to know if this situation is different from chair models or is there a universal expectation for reclining in a new chair? Are there brands for 6""x10"" mechanism models that are reliable and give good reclining experience?"

Recommendations for office chair that can used at 2 different desk heights?,Hello I need a chair  that can be used at a regular desk which is 29 inches tall as well as a craft table that is 36 inches tall. Any recommendations?
,I would look into drafting chairs.
,"You almost certainly need a task stool / drafting chair.

For the regular 29""H desk, you need a seat ~23""H or lower (preferably a little lower) for the desk to be at your resting elbow height. This depends on the length of your arms.

As for the crafting table, seat height depends on what posture you work in. If you need the crafting table below your resting elbow height, then you need a seat higher than 30"" tall."
Looking for advice on a home chair for 4-8 hour sessions,"Hello, I'm looking to upgrade from my current chair, which is the Office Master Truly (800$ chair).  I don't find the plastic back comfortable so I would prefer fabric/cushion.  My tailbone sticks out a bit too, which isn't an issue with my current seat as it curves down in the back.  I'm 6 feet tall, but I can barely apply pressure to the floor with the tall piston at lowest setting, so I'd prefer a standard height chair.  I weigh 140 so I'm really boney/small framed.  I never ever recline in my chair, but I tend to slouch after a few hours.  I get a lot of neck pain (forward head slouching) after a few hours as well, even though I've tried many different sitting positions.  Headrests get in the way for me.  Budget is 2k.  

I've been considering the HM Embody since they recently upgraded the back cushion, and I hear it forgives slouching.  I'll consider any recommendations as well, but I want to get away from plastic backing and mesh, because plastic/framing usually starts hurting wherever it makes contact.  Thank you for reading."

I believe the Zody is one of the best ""blind"" buys as it seems to have enough adjustment to fit most. The only issue may be the shoulder support for taller people, but I've worked in an office with a good 50 people sitting on these, many of the people were tall and they fancied the chair. I am biased as I have 2 Zodies and they're my favorite chair (I also have a Steelcase Please v2 as I'm in Europe where they sell it, and a Haworth Fern, and I also like them both but they won't fit all people)."

I have sat in both and find both to be extremely comfortable. I am 6'3 and 110kg. Only difference in my testing between them was that I could not find a leap with armrests to try, while the fern I tried did have armrests. That might be important given that I unexpectedly found the Haworth Zody with armrests to be a bit narrow around my particularly hefty ass while the armless Zody was not; the armrests on the fern did not have this issue but I have not tried sitting in an armed leap v2 so I don't know if I'd risk a similar problem.

Anyone with thoughts? Please I'm so stuck"
,I am similar size as you and a little heavier. Used the Leap for about a year now. For me if I feel the side of my butt/leg it's definitely bone that is the width not fat. Sat in the Leap a lot of hours and never noticed it being an issue. Then I went to reply to a post similar to ours and noticed it was a little tight on the hips. Then I forgot the post and stopped really noticing it.
,"I would go with what you‚Äôve already tried. The Fern is the better chair. My sister has the digital knit Fern and it‚Äôs super comfy and very similar to my Logitech Embody chair and my Gaming Sayl in that it‚Äôs backrest moves with you in whatever direction you move. 

One thing to note is that the Fern when brand new had a very firm seat pan. Only after a month or so does it break in and become more comfy. If you have the money to buy a new Fern I would suggest you go with a Logitech Embody. Fully loaded they are practically the same price but the seat pan of the Embody is much much bigger and the arm rest bows outwards and you can change their depth from left to right to fit a person with wider hips or more junk in the trunk. I‚Äôve had my Embody for over 1.5yrs now and I sit in it 8+hrs per day 7 days a week and there isn‚Äôt a day that goes by that I am ever uncomfortable. I bought the LE sight unseen so I know you don‚Äôt have to try out the chair to love it. I am 6‚Äô1 and only 160lbs so you outweigh me by a lot but the Embody can hold up to 350lbs. 

Let me know if you have a specific question about any of these chairs. Good luck!"
Thoughts on AMQ chairs or something in $400 price range,"I desperately need to replace my current office chair but have put it off due to being painfully frugal and prone to decision paralysis. I spend hours and hours researching, then buy nothing. I have checked out DWR and an Office Furniture Center OFC. I really liked the Steelcase Amia, Herman Miller Sayl, and Aeron. Brand new is out of my budget, but I just can't wrap my mind around spending $400+ on a used chair, even if that is the going rate. Buying used also seems to require more time and patience than I can invest.

I found these AMQ brand chairs on the Steelcase site that do look promising. They are much more reasonably priced, however, come with a little more risk since they are not included in the high-performance chair category and thus are subject to a 15% restocking fee. I have searched here and on youtube for AMQ reviews but haven't found much.

Has anyone tested an AMQ chair or purchased one? The Siya seems to have a lot of adjustable features for half the price of a decked-out Amia. 

Before learning about the world of high-end chairs, I had been looking at these Costco options. I like Costco because returns are easy but saw on another thread people calling these chairs trash. They seem to have all of the adjustability of the higher-end chairs, so I am wondering if someone can explain why they should be avoided. Is it just that they won't last as long? I am okay with a mid-range chair. I just want something that will allow me to recline a bit and allow me to work for 6-8 hours without pain.

Some advice please. Large gentleman needs decent chair.,"Hello everyone, I'm shopping for an office chair for my younger cousin. He is 6'7"" and I'm guessing 310-330 lbs? Anyway, He has lower back problems and needs a decent computer chair. The only issue is I'm limited to $250 to get him one. His mother is nice enough to help him purchase one and they don't have a whole lot. He just moved into my home from out of town and is just getting started so he does not have much either. I know that in the $250 price range I'm not going to get anything that will last a long time but we just need something now that will help him out. If it lasts 1-2 years then We are good. 

He's not very picky. He just wants to be able to sit and do his work and have some support for his back. Also a deep seat would be ideal as his legs are quite long. I was pretty jazzed up about the ""HON Wave Mesh/Fabric Big and Tall Executive Chair"" and I have a 20% back reward on my credit card. But the price is just too high. I tried to see if I could push my aunt closer to $300 but she really can't do it and I don't want to press the matter. 

So, all of that being said if any of you know of a good lower end chair for a big and tall fella I would really appreciate your guidance. All the best."

Leap v2 stool height/cylinder/weight issues,"I bought a used Leap v2 stool for my standing desk and having issues.

The stool drops 8.5"" inches when I sit on it. Granted, I'm 300lbs... but the stool is rated to 400lbs.   
I have used this model stool in my past job and never had an issue.

I have a $120 chair from Staples that has a stronger cylinder, which only drops about 1"".

Is this a bad cylinder?  
Am I asking too much from the stool?

After 6 chairs that didn't work out for me - any recommendations?,"So I've been on a long journey to find an ergonomic chair that works for me since early 2021. The search is complicated by the fact that my back is all messed up (multiple fusions, although I'm still able to maintain a healthy posture), so I don't always enjoy the leeway of getting used to a chair. After trying most of the flagship models of the big companies, I'm at a bit of a loss as to what my remaining options are. Both my desk and monitor are height adjustable, so I've been able to try out various positions with the chairs I tried. Here's the list as well as the problems I had with them: 

1. Steelcase Please: No matter how I adjusted the back and the armrests, it shifted my shoulders into a positon that caused my cubital tunnel syndrome to resurface (tingling in pinky finger, elbow pain). 
2. Steelcase Leap V2: Lumbar was way to aggressive, caused unbearable pain - even when I removed the optional lumbar support. Otherwise, great chair. 
3. Hag Capisco: Has a very different feel, but the reverse position (with backrest at the front) crushed my balls. Would've been perfect if it wasn't for that problem. 
4. Herman Miller Mirra 2: Another one that was very close to being perfect, but the armrests did not allow me to find a comfortable position. 
5. Herman Milller Embody: No matter how much I tried, the backrest could never fully support my weird back. 
6. Haworth Fern: Also almost perfect, but the high back puts me in a slouching position that causes indigestion. 

So, any recommendations from here on out? The most important things for me would be: 

* Mesh or similarly flexible material preferred - the chair would need to be able to conform to my back to a certain degree
* Should be ergonomic, but also allow for more relaxed, laid back positions. I use the chair for both work-at-home and in my free time (gaming etc.)
* No high back since it might cause me to slouch
* Tilt limiter highly preferred, but since its such a rare feature, I can't really make it a must considering my situation

Does anyone have any recommendations for other chairs I could try out? Price shouldn't be an issue, except when it goes way past 1500 ‚Ç¨. 

Also, if you have any questions regarding the chairs I've tried, feel free to ask."
,You haven‚Äôt tried the Aeron or the Gesture. The Aeron wouldn‚Äôt conform to your back but the Gesture might. I have the Logitech Embody and I love everything about the chair. It moves as I move and backrest molds to my back/spine.
,"If you liked the steelcase leap 2 but weren't a fan of the aggressive lumbar, I highly suggest you take a look at the steelcase Amia. Overall a similar chair, but it has comfier seat padding and the lumbar support is much milder.  You can pick one up for much cheaper than the steelcase leap V2. And they are often under $100 on the used market."
,"Most of the chairs you mentioned are designed to confirm to your back.  Have you tried a simple padded back which should fit most people, like amia or many cheap chairs. Do you have anywhere local to try out office chairs."
,I'd never even heard of the Steelcase Please before. Is that exclusive to Europe?
,"This is very much like where I was, then I sort of kept going. I tried several ergonomic chairs and Capisco too.  Turns out some people are just more sitting intolerant than others, and for me it's about 30m max before I feel discomfort- which just killed my ability to do focused work.  Basically frequent movement had a 10x bigger impact avoiding back pain than any comfort/adjustability combination in any chair.

I've been working on this for the last few years and think we have one possible good answer with a chair that makes it trivial to change posture while you are working (at one consistent height at your desk).  It's quite different though. Look up Movably Pro on youtube, we have a few videos and a first review or message me for more info if of interest."
,"I wouldnt recommend any steelcase, if u like to be laidback, all the recline on them doesnt go that far back."
,Zody
,"I have a refurbished Hawarth Zody. Really nice so far and the lumbar doesn't feel that aggressive. However, don't entirely take my word as my previous chair was a cheap gaming chair and anything is better than that."
,"I have the Mirra 1, which has worked very well for me. It‚Äôs highly adjustable and has a sold build. One can adjust the armrests in many different ways. I like the Mirra 1 better than the Mirra 2. It‚Äôs also cheaper, I got mine for $300 on eBay, brand new."

Raising height of HM Setu chair?,"Hello,

My desk at the lowest height is too high to have a comfortable posture for a full day. Is there a way to raise the setu chair's height?

I currently have 2.5"" wheels, maybe a 4"" caster wheel?  Whenever I try to search for gas cylinder for setu chairs I only get Sayl and aeron chairs. Are they universal? Is this a route you recommend?"
,I wouldn‚Äôt buy a new cylinder. I would buy a keyboard tray for your desk or rollerblade casters for your chair. Rollerblade casters would lift you up .5‚Äù‚Äôs and the keyboard tray should bring the desk down to you level that you need. I hope this helps!
,"Hello!  
A few hours ago, my Leap V2 came in from Crandall. I was able to assemble it without much issue, besides the odd black residue that was hard to wash off. When I looked at the chair though, I noticed how the back pad seemed quite off. I then sat in it, and the backpad felt uncomfortable, leaning just slightly to one side and the bottom of the backpad sticking out. Is this normal?"
,"You know even though it's called a Leap you shouldn't be jumping on it lol. Yes, that backrest does look questionable... u/cranda58 may be able to help you out."
,Yeah that looks pretty strange
,It looks warped to me
,"Mine didn‚Äôt look like that. The bar in the back might be bent, where the backrest attaches"
,That doesn‚Äôt look normal. I would call in your warranty because that chair looks like it‚Äôll make you lean back all the time.
,"UPDATE: The chair's warping seemed to be slightly less severe the next day I check it, but still very uncomfortable, pushing hard into my lower back."
,"The reason for the switch is mainly the thigh pain Herman Miller Aeron caused despite various adjustments I made. Gesture gets quite hot, but at least there's no pain. They both are quite comfortable and look incredible."
,[deleted]
,"May I ask how tall you are? I'm having trouble finding the sweet spot on my gesture. Either my left thigh (only my left!) hurts and/or my right shoulder (and only my right). 

It's making me furious and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

Any suggestions?

I'm 6ft (184cm) and I wonder at which height you have your seat/armrests/table

Thanks!"
,I have done the same but with the Gesture with headrest and have no regrets at all.
,"Congrats on your new chair!

-DC"
,"I made exactly the same switch, and to the same colour combo Gesture as yourself, except I had the headrest model. I gave the Aeron several months but could not get used to it, it was causing discomfort / pain in the back of my thights. All that discomfort went within a few weeks of getting the Gesture. Great char."
,"Waiting on delivery of my Gesture now. I didn't try any of the HMs, but I was pretty happy with my loaner Gesture. The Leap, by comparison, was not for me. Just obviously wasn't built for somebody my size (6'3"" 300+)."
,That‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôm swithing from Gesture to an Aeron. Mainly because I didn‚Äôt get the headrest at the time for my Gesture and you can‚Äôt get one added later especially the newer models with the fabric wrapping over the back even third party headrests wouldn‚Äôt fit it. My Aeron arrives tomorrows and I decide to get an Atlas headrest for it.
,The Gesture is a nice chair but I wouldn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs better than the Aeron though.

steelcase leap v2 back squeaking,"I recently noticed the back of my leap v2 squeaking when i push back into the lower back part of it ( so not reclining back ).

It seems to be the squishy lower back plastic or something when it flexes it, it or something inside of it, makes a squeaking noise. As far as I can hear, it doesnt sound like its coming from under the chair or anything. Does anyone know about this squeak or how to solve it?"
,"You can lube inside the chair, just take off the seat(screws in the back i believe) and lube the gas cylinder with wd-40. My leap v1, squeeks like that too. I guess its common if its old, i believe theres a guide from crandal office on youtube."

Question about armrests: Are they always too short?,"So I've tested a large number of office chairs.  I've spent hundreds of hours in Aeron, Leap, Leapv2, Freedom chair, and the Think.  In all of these chairs, the armrests are always a bit low - that is, if I'm not slouching, and the armrest is as high as it goes, my elbows do not touch the armrest - my arm always hangs downwards slightly and touches mid-forearm.  Sure, if I lean slightly, I can touch one elbow, and if I slouch I can touch both.  But not if I'm sitting as correctly as possible.

Do I just have short arms, or is this intentional?"
,"My understanding is that your elbow is supposed to be bent at approximately 90¬∞ with your forearm able to rest on the arm support.  

Do you have cartoon dinosaur arms?"
,"Not sure what frame you're working with but Im 6'2 and my elbows/forarms fit fine an all of the chairs you mentioned armrests...

Also keep in mind chairs often have a few different Arm variations....fixed arms and basic Height adjustable arms are typically cheaper and less desirable than the standard highly adjustable 4-way (height, width, pivot, depth) arms.

But even on the sub-standard arm styles I have not had any issue.

Maybe tiny arms?  


\-Colin at TheBackStore"
,You definitely have short arms.
,How long are your arms? Lol might need to go on Amazon and buy a pad that makes the arm rest thicker to get your elbow on it right.
Thoughts on recline mechanisms?,"Mainly curious about knee vs synchro tilt. There are medium and high end chairs that have either. Is one considered better for a certain kind of use case like tasking/typing versus talking on the phone, or does it mostly come down to preference?"
Is the Steelcase Gesture headrest really that bad?,"I'm leaning towards the Gesture, but I absolutely need a headrest. My only concern is that it will push my head too far forward, as seen [here](https://youtu.be/7wG5UqCH_mY?t=842), especially when trying to fully recline and relax. 

I'm the same height as Dan Ahn in that video, so I imagine it would fit me similarly. It seems to be a problem not just for short users. None of the reviewers at BTOD are a fan of the Gesture headrest either, and they range from 5'8"" to 6'3"".

Is it likely to be uncomfortable if I want to kick back for extended periods? Is that even possible in the Gesture, or does the mechanism tend to put you back into a more upright position even as you lean back?

For anyone who has used the Gesture with a headrest, did you get used to it, or is it as bad as the reviews claim?"
,"I sit in a Gesture with a Headrest as my daily driver and personally feel like it's one of the better headrests out there of all the chairs I have used - the only other headrest I like maybe a little better is the Aeron Atlas Headrest (Similar adjustability and support, but I like the feel and give of the mesh on that headrest a touch better), but that's an aftermarket product, not an OEM headrest.

I am about 5'8"" and just over 200lbs and I have found the headrest on the Gesture to accommodate me very well. I can set it up to be supportive while I'm sitting up right or if I'm leaning back. (I don't do a ton of lounging while at work though, so I typically use this chair in a much more upright position with the headrest adjusted to support my neck and head). This may just be how I personally like and interact with the chair, but I absolutely love the headrest on my Gesture, and this is coming from someone who for many many years though headrests were just gimmicks - this is the chair that changed my opinion on that.

Just my $0.02 :)

,"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 4‚Äù, 210 lbs. while I don‚Äôt lounge for an extended period of time, i do fully recline for a few mins and have no issue with the headrest. Sometimes I might feel the need to adjust it; but, that doesn‚Äôt happen too often. 

I purchased my Gesture new from a local office store. Got it with the headrest, tall cylinder, and lumbar option. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing if I had to order another. 

As for the lumbar option, I don‚Äôt know what the chair feels like without the lumbar option so can‚Äôt say if you should get it or not. I just now I‚Äôm comfortable in my chair as-is. Yes, the chair took a day or to to get used to but I think it‚Äôs great!

If I remember correctly, I felt that the Gesture reclined more than the Leap. I thought I was going to tip over the first time I declined all the way."
,"For what its worth, we sell significantly more Gestures with headrest than Gestures without. We get very very little complaints about the comfortability of the headrest, but everybody's different, there will always be someone whose not a fan. You're right to assume it definitely does look like it would push your head too far forward based on the pictures/videos. But I'd suggest maybe trying one out first and see how it fits you.  


Not much more to be said that hasn't already been said other than you can always remove the headrest on the gesture chair if you don't like it or don't want it from time to time. It's by no means a permanent fixture.  
The chair I'm currently using at work is a gesture with the headrest removed.

Also what /u/ergothrone said I agree with. May also need a footrest based on the strangely high desk if you cant get a keyboard tray."
,Or perhaps the Mirra 2 is correcting your posture when you‚Äôre in the office but when you‚Äôre at home you are back to your bad posture which you‚Äôre already used to.

That‚Äôs just a theory and I could be wrong.

Looking for something with a high back and headrest, something that can recline decently far, and has a recline mechanism and locking arm rests as described below. Ideally below 600.

Had a secretlabs omega and upgraded to an uplift pursuit for better ergonomics, mainly lumbar support that wasn't ""here's a pillow"". I hate that the arm rests jiggle freely on the uplift. I want something that locks in place. Also I liked how the secretlabs recline lock functioned. You set the lock and could still recline freely while the lock set the furthest distance forward the recline mechanism would be allowed to go. When you lock the recline on the uplift, it's locked in place. When you unlock it, the seat back travels too far forward for my liking.

The arm rests, the recline mechanism, and general squeaks and creaks in the uplift have me about to huck this thing through the window. Does something like what described above exist in my price range or should I just say screw it and get the titan evo? 

I did check out that site that sells the refurb steelcase chairs but everything I saw with a headrest was ""hey bro drop a thousand plus on it""."
,"I know two chairs for you, one good and cheap and the other great and just within your price limit. One has the armrests you want, the other has the backrest you want."
,Locking armcaps isn't very common. Allsteel acuity has them but doesn't fit most of your other wants.
"Any way to shorten a Secret Lab Titan Evo 2022 (""gaming chair"") by like 0.5-1 inch? Or much more than that?","Hi,

I bought a Secret Lab Titan Evo 2022 about a year ago and I'm mostly very happy with it.  I was dealing with some neck pain flares at the time, and I really needed something with flat, basic neck support so I could tuck an ice pack or a small pillow and change them out as needed depending on how cranky my neck was that day.  This, along with reducing stress in my life, has really helped my neck.  The humanscale Freedom looked like a possible option for me, but was more than I was willing to spend so I went with the Evo

&#x200B;

**The problem:**

Now the problem is just that I can't reach the floor and this kinda hurts my toes / knees.

If I sit back in the chair, my heels dangle about half an inch off the ground.  I got the chair in size small, which shrinks everything about the regular size down to fit me - but they didn't make the seat height any shorter.

*(I'd ideally love to shorten its minimum height by several inches so I can put a cushion down on mine and so I can also shorten my partner's who is several inches shorter than me.  She likes footrest, but still would be happier if it was shorter)*

&#x200B;

**How I've tried to compensate for it:**

I've tried to compensate for this with ""chair heels"", which are essentially fluffy platform slippers lol, but I find them annoying and would love to just be able to put my feet on the floor.  I fidget a lot and hate most footrests (I have one of the old hovr footrests, kinda like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Swurfer-Swing-Adjustable-Anxiety-Boredom/dp/B08CF5138R/), and really like it sometimes, but its no substitute for the floor).

I've looked for shorter cylinders, but I don't know if any of them would fit this chair because the bottom is kind of funky.  I'm in Canada, but can pretty easily import stuff from the US.

What should I buy if I don't like Steelcase Leap?,"Bought a refurbished Steelcase Leap V1, and I am probably going to return it. It is too firm for me, and the back is too low. I am 6 foot tall. 

Would I like the V2 if I don't like the V1? Is it more comfortable? 

What are some other good options?  

I need something comfortable because I sit down to play video games, go to class/study, and work."
,"Where did you buy it?  Was it a high back v1 or low back V1? The high back v1 and v2 are very simmilar in height. 
Crandall uses much thicker foam on their remanufactured V1 which you can get on the high back model.

https://www.crandalloffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/New-Steelcase-Leap-Seat-Pad-01.jpg

 Their V2 remanufactured model also uses the same thicker foam.  Note: the normal v2 has thinner foam than the normal v1.

Here is a video comparing the two sizes of the V1 to the v2

Here is a video with the advanatges and dissadvantages of the V1 Highback and V2

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkpu42qQRjI"
,"Although I do believe the Leap V2 should be a little less firm due to it being built with lighter weight more environmentally sustainable materials...I think if you don't like the old V1 you probably wont like the V2 either.

Keep in mind though any new/refurbished chair does take some time to break in, your body needs to adjust to the angles and pressure points of the chair no matter how comfortable it is. It's rare for one to feel they're sitting on a cloud on day 1.Some of my coworkers sit in a Leap for 8+ hours a day and love how they never feel any pain or discomfort.

An alternative suggestion would be the Herman Miller Aeron chair. As someone who doesn't mind mesh, its my personal favorite not only because of how comfortable it is but also its breathability helps you stay cool during those intense gaming sessions or crunch times at work.

,Steelcase Leapv2 would be better.
Looking for a new office chair for programming and watching shows,I recently purchased a new desk and PC and now I want to purchase a new office chair. My current chair was given to me for free and is not the most comfortable out there. I am looking for a chair that will promote decent posture that is comfortable since I suffer from severe lower-back pain from time to time. I work as a programmer full-time and I also use my setup for gaming and video editing. My price range is anything between $200 to $750.
,"You can find a lot of good refurbished/used options in your price range. But if you spend more than 1/3rd of your day sitting, I would recommend investing in a new high-end chair that will last. I value my office chair at home like I value my mattress, I'll spend whatever I need to spend to make sure that I am taken care of if such a significant chunk of my day is spent using it. No one wants to have back pain or other issues building up over time, Its best to not try and cut corners on costs if you can afford it when it comes to your long term health (in my opinion).  


I would recommend the Steelcase Gesture, Leap V2, or Herman Millers Aeron, Embody. They're expensive but if you find one of those that works for you it'll be worth every penny.  


I helped a programmer friend of mine (whom I met through gaming) get their hands on one of those Logitech x Herman Miller collab on the Embody chair. I think they're super cool if you're a tech guy. My buddy loves his but everybody's different. Hope this helps.

,"$200 to $750 is kind of like saying im looking for a car for $20k to $40k. Its a huge range.  I just decided on a remanufactured Steelcase Leap from Crandall Furniture.  You can get phenominal deals on used chairs on craigslist, but you never know what condition they are actually in and if the foam is going to last.  Certain too good to be true online stores are very hit or miss.  Remanufactured seemed like a good compromie as you get new (and arguably better) foam and upholstry with a warranty at about half price."

Clatina Mellet - Price increase,"Noticed that the Clatina Mellet recently increased in price and thought that the price change may make the chair a bit less budget friendly. I have seen the chair marketed by different companies (Lorrel as the Serenity) so I felt like there might be a chance it is marketed cheaper through other companies, which it seems like it is. See link:

https://www.ebay.com/itm/115204998643?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=J5j8_Y8hQTe&sssrc=2349624&ssuid=C7VhMvgqSze&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY

I ordered one and will report back. Seems to be the same chair given the specs and is much cheaper than even the base price ($120 here). 

Thought this may help a few people if you are interested in the chair.

Steelcase Amia Leather,"Is the back of this normal for 3 days of use?  Was completely flat when I got it.  I am 6 ft 200 lbs so not fat but not small either.  My old cheap staples chair in the background didn't hurt my back like this one and I used it for 3 years.  I got this directly from the dealer. I wanted a high-quality chair because a recent visit to the ER showed I had a lower back disk slightly out of place, and I thought it was probably from my posture and the chair in the background. The price of this was $1500 but through work, I got it for $700. The leather feels nice and of high quality, but for such an expensive chair I feel like it shouldn't wrinkle so fast. Was never wet or anything.  The lumber digs into my back no matter where I put it.  I have lower back pain now as before I rarely did.  I thought maybe this is just my body adjusting to a better posture.  What do you guys think?

,"Similar boat and I think my options are secret lab titan xl as the top end of the lower price tier (and by lower I mean sub $600), or one of these 24/7 dispatch chairs for $1,500+

Can't bring myself to spend more than a grand, and despite a couple friends reporting that that the titans are nice, I get a feeling it'll be more plastic than I want or not as long lasting

There's also all those steelcases and herman miller and whatnot but in my experience they're more ergo focused than plush comfy.

Rollin an ikea markus the last 6 years or so, it's also not plush comfy but it was good enough and had a nice high back so for $150 the value was there (looks like theyre 270 now and I don't think I'd buy it again at that price)"

I‚Äôve sat and worked in it all today and it‚Äôs horrible. My back hurts from supporting itself. If I sit back in the chair for support, it automatically leans back and my god, does it lean back completely. Instead I find myself sitting up and not leaning against the back. 

Is this a normal feature of the think? Should I sell this and get a different chair? I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not too savvy on office chairs and may have jumped the gun to get this but reviews on Reddit were seemingly positive. I feel like I wasted $400."

,There's one in the back that has a lumbar support. Maybe that one if you don't have time to keep looking for good chair deals. I tried the Think and my impression was that it doesn't support the lumbar spine well enough. Although my lower back is very sensitive and needs lumbar support that that doesn't bend.

I spent alot of time browsing this sub in recent weeks and came across a suggestion from the Crandall Office team to another Canadian user to buy from Envirotech in Southern Ontario as they no longer ship to Canada so I bit the bullet and ordered a chair from this company on the 23rd of August and it arrived today in great condition!

The cylinder is brand new, the locking mechanism works perfectly on all settings, arm rests look pristine and the recline is as smooth as a new chair.

,"I like the degree of adjustability with the Gesture, but I've seen complaints from short users that indicate it might not be a good fit. At 5'6"" I'm worried that the angle might be too aggressive, and it would press against the neck in the wrong place. 

There are also general complaints about the Leap and Series 1 headrests, but mostly for the opposite reason, that they aren't far enough forward or supportive at all. 

My main use for the headrest is to recline back fully and relax, not for extra support while tasking. Would any of thse work for me?"
,i hate the right side because it prevents you from resting your shoulders onto the chair.
,"Between those 3, the Gesture headrest is far and away more adjustable than the others. The Leap and Series 1 HR's only adjust up and down (on a bit of a curve though, so they do protrude more outwards as they go up, but that is almost a downside in my opinion). My vote goes Gesture :)

Steelcase Leap v2 isn't working for me...,"I bought this chair a couple of months ago and I just can't sit in it for long. I'm going to sell it and try to find something else.

Anyone around 6'3"" 230lbs. that can recommend a comfortable chair?"

Leap V2 from Crandall,"https://preview.redd.it/m70r755gnal91.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4d56082327e9652a36161b31993a7ca5c326af7

Just received my new chair from Crandall. It is the remanufactured Leap V2 with their blue bio-knit fabric (Splash color), the new padded seat and the extra padded back.

Overall, the ordering process was very smooth, and the chair got here quick. I ordered it over the weekend and received it today. Assembly was super easy after watching their assembly video and only took 5 - 10 mins.

The chair feels very comfortable so far, but I've only had minutes in it. However, I do have a few questions that maybe someone from the community or Crandall could answer:

1. The left arm pad mechanism makes a plasticky, rattling sound whenever the chair rolls over the floor. Is this normal for a Leap? The Aeron I'm used to is super quiet, but I also understand that this chair is not built like a tank the way the Aeron is.
2. The seat pad has a strong odor of women's perfume. I figured since I had ordered the new bio-knit fabric, alongside the new padded foam that Crandall makes, the seat and back would not have any smells associated with them, besides some VOCs.

Thanks in advance!"
,"Hey there - Dave from Crandall Office here - can you message me a quick video of exactly what's going on with your arm? I'd like to take a closer look at that. Regarding the seat smell - the only thing I can think of there is that the foam is brand new (and we just got a new batch in, so it's extra brand new), and we do use an upholstery adhesive to attach the fabric to the foam. If there's any smell originating from either of those products, it should not hang around long. If whatever smell you've got there does not start to go down or go away in the next week or so, let me know and we'll get you a replacement seat sent out, and I'll make sure to personally give it the sniff test before it leaves haha

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help! :)

I recently went to try out chairs there since my $50, generic, Target office chair recently gave out after about 7 years. I quickly noticed the prices were a lot higher than what I was expecting but figured my back and comfort would be worth it. My favorite of the ones I tried was the WorkPro¬Æ Momentum Ergonomic Mesh Active High-Back Chair, so I was wondering if anyone is familiar with this brand or specific chair even. 

I'd be open to recommendations in that price range (preferably $450 or less) if anyone cares to share their expertise. The only must for me would be a head rest, as a majority of the time at my desk I'm wearing fairly large over ear headphones and want to be able to lay my head back and listen.

Thank you all!"
,They are shaped like ergonomic chairs and not much else in my opinion.
,"Found on facebook Marketplace. 
In need a good used home office chair and was looking at the leap v2  but then I found this simply labelled ""Office Chair"". Comparing it to images on steelcase's website + other sources it seems to be an Amia. If so, that would be amazing and I'd grab it right away. I'm hoping one of you could help me?"
,"If it is an Amia the arm rests, the arm rest supports, and the seat height adjustment as well as the back tension knob are totally different than any Amia I've bought. I can't think of any other chair it could be. I wasn't aware of a Amia clone."
,Love the fabric!
,"It's the SitOnIt Amplify upholstered back! I could tell it was SitOnIt by the armrests but I didn't look hard enough for the model until you confirmed the brand OP. I didn't know before that the Amplify could come with an upholstered backrest.

It's no Amia but it's still a very good chair easily worth more than $60."
,"Even if it's a sitonit amplify, focus, novo, realign. As long as everything works on this chair $60 is still a great price!"
,"If it all works, it‚Äôs a steal"
,"The armpads look different to me, never seen them look like htat. But it does look like an Amia. At $60 it's a steal."
,"Yes Definitely an Amia, and $60 is a great price!!

Definitely a unique, non standard fabric, but I like it!!

On the hunt for a new chair,"Hi all! I am on the hunt for a new chair as my current one is around 5 years old and was ~$80 from office max. I got a replacement cushion a little while ago and it slightly helped, but now I am getting some solid upper back pain from slouching/not sitting up right just due to no back support and the chair being slightly tilted.

Im in the chair for around 8 hours a day as I work from home, so comfort and support is #1 in my book. Also prefer to have a new chair rather than used. My budget is around $300-$400 for something nice and sturdy!

Given your height, make sure to select the highback and adjustable depth seat options!

,I think the Series 1 is going to be the only good branded chair that you can get for your budget. I had the Series 1 but I hated it because it didn‚Äôt work for me. I got it from my employer brand new. After sitting on it for 2hrs my bum would start to hurt so I ended up getting my employer to buy me a Logitech Embody.
Good Ergochair pro alternative?,I find that the ergochair pro has a lot of desirable features  but lacks quality. I‚Äôve  seen the Clatina Mellet and Steelcase Series 2 w/ headrest but I want a chair with all of the ergonomic features they have that can also lock at different angles. Is there any new chair that has those featurs and also looks decent for under $1000?
,"So I don't know anything amazing for you unfortunately, but the WorkPro Momentum has all the features you want at a much better value than the ErgoChair Pro. And yes, it has true tilt *lock* in multiple positions.

Some Office Depot stores have a sample on display; you may want to call your local store ahead of time to make sure they have one on disay."
,The Mellet does tilt lock in multiple angles.

"Steelcase Options, Less then $800.","Hi Everyone, 


Does anyone have any suggestions for a chair from Steelcase? I'm between the Series 1- Series 2, but looked at Amia.  After looking through this subreddit, it seems like a lot of people are in favor of the Series 2 over the 1.  Of course there are mentions about the Leap, but it's out of the price range I want.  My criteria are: 


-Steelcase - I get a discount through work with them.  

-New - I hate buying used furniture.  I'm sensitive to certain environmental smells like smoke, cats, etc.  

-Headrest - I saw the Amia does not have an option for a headrest, hence why checked it off the list.  

-Comfortable for short people.  

-Sitting up to 8 hours a day, but I get up very often.  


Thanks in advance for everyone's help!"
,"Get a used Steelcase leap v2, I know you said you don't like used furniture but a ""like new"" leap v2 will run you about 425 on ebay or a local store around your area. I would give a couple stores that liquidate closed down office furniture and you would be surprised as to how new everything looks. Most don't come with a head rest but I've seen alot of post on here about ways to custom fit your own headrest on that seem pretty easy."
,"Hard no on the Series 1.

I'd be against the Steelcase Series 2 for you due to its really firm seat, but since you stand up often it should be okay."
,Would a series 2 headrest fit on an Amia air? I know the backs are very similar.
,"Both the Series 1 and Series 2 are very hit or miss. People either absolutely love them or hate them. Seems to come down to the individual, I'd recommend trying them out in person first.  
We have been getting a lot of positive feedback on the newer Series 2 Air-Back chair's that are a little bit more affordable than the fully upholstered Series 2, but you'd have to like that style.  


\-New- , I am 100% with you, I don't buy anything used when it comes to high-usage furniture. I always figured if im going to spend thousands of hours in something over the course of years, I see these purchases as a worthy investment in myself to be the first owner.  
That being said, you may want to explore refurbished chairs. Refurbished options can be nearly indistinguishable from brand new chairs. Despite the ""bones"" of the chair often coming from returns/used liquidations, the good refurbs usually come with new upholstery and arms which is the only part your body actually touches. If I had a tight budget I would consider it.

Initial opinions and experience with Crandall Office Refurb Leap V2,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to make this post to share my initial thoughts and opinions on the refurb Steelcase Leap V2 I received from Crandall Office, now that I have had about a week to get some of my first impressions on it. 

First and foremost, I love the chair. And not just in a ‚ÄúOh this chair should last me a year or two‚Äù way. The chair seems built very reliably and sturdy, and outside a few dings and scratches on the frame, I would be hard pressed to tell you it wasn‚Äôt in like new condition. The chair does have some overall noise to it when reclining, but nothing major, and certainly nothing I don‚Äôt think some WD40 could fix if I wasn‚Äôt too lazy to actually put some in the joints. It arrived fast and on time within their 5-10 day window, and including shipping time I would say it took about a week to arrive at my door step after ordering.

The reupholstery job also looks fantastic, and I am glad I went with the wine colored bioknit. No complaints on that front at all, the fabric looks great and is very breathable, and I absolutely love the color of it. I also went with the additional thicker foam padding on both the seat and the back of the chair, and while they are both firm, the firmness is not uncomfortable or irritating in any way. While I did have some initial discomfort the first day or two using the chair, I feel this was mainly my body adjusting to having actual proper posture and the chair itself, and by about the 3rd day and beyond, I have had absolutely no pain outside of some minor soreness in the upper back, which could again be due to my body still adjusting to the altered posture. My legs and tailbone region also no longer experience any pain when sitting for longer than an hour or two, which is the major problem I have had with my other cheaper and poorer built office chairs consistently. While pain in this region does still set in after a while, it is much less pronounced, and is taking much much longer to happen in the Leap. I also honestly believe the pain in this region over long sitting periods may go away entirely the longer I use and develop better posture in the chair, as I have noted being able to sit for increasingly longer periods without needing to get up as days have gone on. It also may just be my body telling me I need to get up and move it a little regardless of the chair, and while it is probably better I take occasional breaks, I am very guilty of long sessions at my desk where I rarely get up.

I do have one minor gripe about the chair however, which is the adjustable lumbar pad. The overall shape of the chair is fantastic and helps keep my lower back supported throughout the day, but I have had some annoyance with adjusting the lumbar pad. When I go to set the lumbar pad to a set height, it moves very easily to the position I want it to be in, however, as I sit and use the chair, I can note the lumbar pad slowly moving back down lower and lower on the chair until eventually stopping around the same spot slightly above the bottom of the back frame. While this spot it ends up in is not terribly uncomfortable, I really wish the lumbar pad could stay put without me having to adjust it every day whenever it start noticing it out of place and not at the height I set it. I am not sure if this is a feature of the chair‚Äôs flexible back or just something the lumbar pad does in general, but it is something I have definitely noticed.

Outside of this one minor gripe though I have started to fall in love with using this chair. After going through back and butt pain hell from sitting in terrible college library and dorm chairs, a gaming chair, and a lazboy that was not nearly as comfortable and ergonomic as advertised, I feel I have finally found a chair that makes me not dread and actually love working and sitting at my desk for long periods. 

Being a college student in a very hard major going into their last year of undergrad that tends to spend anywhere from 4 hours on a good day to 8+ hours on a bad day at my desk working and studying, this is huge for me. I used to dread and avoid working at my desk as long as possible simply because of how much pain and discomfort I would end up feeling after a while, and now, I actually look forward to getting some work done and being productive, as I know the Leap isn‚Äôt going to punish me for trying to actually get some honest work done. Having the adjustments on the Leap that are not on any of my other chairs I have used is also a game changer, as I no longer have to sit far away from my desk due to lack of adjustability in the arms, or hunched over away from the back of the chair due to bad seating angles. 

The chair feels like it actively tries to adapt to what I am doing and where my body is moving to throughout the day, and with how it has the ability to stay put in certain seating angles due to the stickiness of its recline positions, I have never felt like I am stuck or can‚Äôt get myself in a comfortable position while using it.

I do have to thank Dave and the rest of the team at Crandall for doing such a great job on refurbishing the chair and giving it a new life, as I fully plan on taking this chair and putting it through its paces each day with my plans to go to grad school. The chair is going to get a lot of love from me, especially on my 8+ hour studying/working days from hell, but at least I know it will have my back (literally)!"
,"u/cranda58
Take a bow."
,"Happy you had a great experience with Crandall's team! If it makes you feel any better about your one gripe, almost all adjustable lumbar pads across many different manufacturers will slide down as you sit and you will have to readjust. I don't think this is a flaw on Crandall or Steelcase.

My chair at home, even when brand new, the lumbar pad would slide down to the near bottom of the backrest over time. I'm sure it has something to do with the gravity/pressure of a body pressing against it and posture shifting. In my opinion the annoyance of adjusting the adjustable lumbar pads frequently isn't as bad as having a fixed lumbar support that cant be moved at all.

\-Colin at TheBackStore"
,"Thanks for sharing the review. About to purchase one myself, so I'm curious - can you list all the options you selected? Seems like you went with:

* Upgrade to a 2021 Chair? Chair made between 2007-2014
* Back Pad: New thicker back pad
* Adjustable Lumbar: Yes
* Gas Cylinder: ?
* Upholstery Color: Bioknit Wine
* New Caster Options: ?

Also, thanks for taking that last BioKnit Wine - I was planning to get one!"
,"Glad you like the chair. I bought a used Leap but did have Crandall replace the back and seat with their additional cushioned versions, also in bioknit wine. Love it.

I will tell you my lumbar support does not move on my chair. It stays out when not sitting in the chair, and when I sit in it's almost impossible to move, I have to lean forward to take the pressure off the back before I can move the lumbar support."

,"Well it requires a power coaxial power connector, often known as DC barrel connectors. They all look the same so you'll have to somewhat accurately measure the diameter of the female side.

Impossible to know what power it expects though unless stated somewhere on the chair."
,"Best guess here is a 12V DC connector with the center pin positive, outer is ground. Standard input connector just shielded."

My Experience with High Back Chairs,"I have been trying out some high-back office chairs for the past few weeks. I am 5'11 and have a longer torso than average. Here is my experience with the chairs I have tried so far.

**Haworth Fern**: The backrest has an S shape similar to the human spine curve. It has a flexible multiple-layer structure that adapts to your back to some degree. The top part of the backrest is concave. This causes major discomfort for me, as my shoulder is higher than the backrest and its hard plastic top digs into my shoulder and there is no support for my shoulder blades.

**Herman Miller x Logitech Embody**: Its backrest has an S shape similar to the Fern. At the upright position, the top part is also concave and forces me into a rounded shoulder posture that is not healthy. The issue can be alleviated by adjusting the backfit knob to pull the backrest backward and flatten the top part. However, even at the max setting, I still feel the push on my shoulders which is uncomfortable.

**Steelcase Gesture**: I only tried it at a local dealer for about 15 minutes. The top of its backrest is more flat compared to Fern and Embody, and I did not experience discomfort on my shoulders. However, if I lean back, the aggressive lumbar bump becomes even more prominent and causes discomfort.

**Ikea Markus**: I have been using it for 7 years. The top part of the backrest is flat and does not cause discomfort to me. The only issue is that the armrests are not adjustable and bump into my desk. This may be fixed by some DIY work.

&#x200B;

Overall, the Fern and the Embody are the most uncomfortable for me among these four, due to their concave top of the backrest which causes discomfort if you have a long torso. Your mileage may vary though."
,"I think I am your same body type and I'm looking for a new chair. I'm glad you are mentioning this because I did not see it in any of the other reviews. I am currently primarily considering the Steelcase Leap, but have also been considering the Gesture, Embody, Fern, and Amia."
,"Just out of curiosity, how long did you try each chair out for? Generally chairs have an adjustment period as your body gets used to sitting in a different way. It's really not easy to judge a chair just off a few days of sitting or less. I'm very surprised you hear the ferns backrest didn't come up above your shoulders, I'm at 6'2 and mine don't go above it. 

Did you make sure to adjust your seat depth with each model, and relax into the back? It's good to not try and sit perfectly pressed into the back."
I need a decent computer chair for my wife for under $350,"Title.

I just built my wife a nice gaming computer. Spent a little more than intended (who doesn't these days?) and had realized I forgot one of the most important factors. the chair.

I've looked around a bit, and it looks like the clatina mellet or something by Branch comes pretty well recommended in the price range. Ive noticed that none of these chairs in any price range seem to be any sort of the leather office max style chairs. are they just less supportive?"
,Start up at the top of this sub with the mega thread.  LMK if you have any questions.
,">Ive noticed that none of these chairs in any price range seem to be any sort of the leather office max style chairs. are they just less supportive? 

They're less supportive of healthy posture and less comfortable for long sits. They're also less durable - bonded leather peels and cracks within the first year."

Seafoam Green Digital Knit Back Custom Haworth Fern with All Features,"Upgraded to my Fern chair from a Steelcase Think task chair after having physical pain from it for years due to it not fitting my body right. For reference, I have average length legs but a very long torso and at 6 ft tall.

The seat of the Think worked really well for me, but the back support was incorrect for my body and was causing me many issues. The Fern has gone a massive way with dealing with the source of the problem with my back pain. Pairing it with a standing desk and an Ergodriven standing desk mat has helped dramatically too.

For the colors, I really debated on which knit back to go for and which seat fabric to pair with it. My local Haworth dealer in Canada was incredibly accommodating and was a big factor in why I chose the Fern over anything from Herman Miller or Steelcase. I decided to go for a pop of color because it's too easy for me to just use black accents in my home office. They also gave me a demo chair with all of the same features less the digital knit back which was very beneficial.

The Herman Miller dealer I went to in my city was extremely pretentious which turned me off, but I still explored their chairs after expecting the Embody or Aeron to be great for me, but they didn't fit my body well after much trying. The Embody pushed the top of my shoulders far forward, which was not comfortable for me.

I also checked out a Steelcase dealer to try the Gesture, and it was a close runner up. I think it might have a bit of a better waterfall roll on the seat and even better 4D arms, and the back support was good on the Gesture for me, but on the Fern it was just another level of amazing back support for me, and that was the deciding factor for my purchase."
,Very nice!! Does the knit give a different feeling to the back or is it just cosmetic? Sat in a lot of ferns but always with the rhythm/runner fabrics
,very nice
,Defiitely fits your car perfectly which is all that matter.
,"That's good, what keyboard is that?"
,What speakers are they? And are you jadon?
,"Which fabric did you go with for the seat, and which do you think is the softest option?

I'm currently trying to decide between Tellure, Oceanic, and Blanket."
,I was considering avoiding the digital knit version just because I'm worried my cat would scratch the hell out of it. How did you handle it?
,"I know this is a bit of an older post but I happened across it just now, love the chair! I‚Äôve been looking into getting a fern and will hopefully have an appointment with a local dealer this week. I‚Äôve done some experimenting on the Haworth site and have priced out something custom that comes to over 2k. I‚Äôve heard local dealers give pretty good discounts and when I talked to mine they also mentioned GSA discounts which I would qualify for (federal). If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, did you price that chair out on their website to compare what the discount was that you got from your local dealer? What did it end up costing for a custom color and everything? How was the lead time to get it delivered? Thanks for any info!

Edit: kept reading and saw the price you paid lol. Would still love to know about the lead time though :)"

Finally made the Leap(V2). (With Crandall),"So I picked up a Leap V2 from Crandall. 569$. Not bad, not great either. I had been for years considering an Aeron when they were around 900$-1000$. But prices skyrocketed from what I can tell and are now like 1600$. Used office furniture stores and whatnot around me, impossible to find anything. 

So after much research between BOTD and Crandall and reviews of both, I went Crandall. It said it'd take 8-10 days to ship, it shipped the next day and arrived a few days later. 

The box arrived damaged with a big hole in the front, and a small one on the bottom. Shipped via UPS.

Upon opening, I can very easily see why a hole was there. The base which the casters screw into  - was pointed outwards, so any pressure applied would obviously make a hole. I'm abit surprised at how this is packaged, honestly, it's very basic stuff. I work for USPS and see poor packing jobs like this often. It should've been a slightly bigger box, insulated with some foam, or even just turning it around(But then this would also injure the seatpan under circumstances). 

Examining it, I found one small dent on the bottom, however nothing that would affect performance. 

Examining the seatpan, I found a small piece of plastic that supports the the slide onto the chair frame was busted and hanging off. As far as I could tell, this does not affect operation.

Putting the chair together was fairly simple and a straightforward process, made even easier with a BOTD video on assembly. 

In no time at all, the chair was together, I noticed on the arms a small dent in one, almost looked like a sharp nail had been pressed in - not torn, but it left a permanent mark. I don't see how it could've happened in delivery, but it'd be very pedantic to find fault with as it's something that doesn't affect usage at all. 

I examined all the mechanisms closely. There was no rust, maybe some rough spots where things looked a little worn, but nothing unusual there. I experienced no creaking when operating any mechanisms, and I am about 240 pounds, so not that light either. Leaning back is smooth.

As for the chair, it's very comfortable. I noticed right away from my old Aera office chair that the seatpan didn't bottom out due to the high density foam. Adjusting lumbar is an ongoing process as I find it does not move with you when you recline, a slight annoyance, but that's the design.

As for the Arms, I dislike them. They are very narrow, even pushed out as far as they go. I've been thinking of removing them and maybe having no arms or finding aftermarket ones that are normal. I can't understand the need for the ""4D""ness of them. Adjusting height and width makes sense, but angle really does not. Especially with no ""Lock in place"" feature. 

It's a smooth glide, even using the carpet casters on a hardwood floor.  It's easy to hit all the adjustment controls and feels much more natural than others I've used.

I went in fully expecting to hate dropping almost 600$ on a office chair, even knowing that was a significant price difference from ""new"". I knew the legendary status of this chair and was already prepared to scoff at it.

But I'm really enjoying it.

I bought it off Amazon, so I couldn't customize it any with bionit or hardwood casters(easy for me to just buy some myself really).

I'd rate the chair itself a 4.5/5.

On Crandall's end, I'd rate it a 4/5, one star reduced due to the minor damage to the chair, nothing that apparently affects operation, but all of it could've been easily avoided with a little more thought put into packaging.(Seriously, who decided to put a jutting circular pressing firmly outwards against the side of the box? I'm surprised it's not something I read about all the time when reading reviews)."
,"Hey there - Dave with Crandall Office here - thank you very much for your very detailed review! I appreciate both the kind words as well as the criticisms. 

I'd love if you could send over a few pictures of the small issue you found on the seat slide mechanism - I know you said it doesn't seem to affect operation, but I'd love to take a closer look regardless. Same goes for the arm pad - if somethings wrong there, we can definitely get you a replacement.

As for packaging - we've gone through several iterations of packaging on the Leap and have been using this specific process for quite some time with very little damage, but I will sit down with our shipping team today and see if we feel like we can further improve our packaging based on this recommendation. Sometimes customers get to see things much differently than us (especially after it's gone through UPS's system), so this kind of feedback is awesome, and not always something we get unless there's meaningful damage to the chair.

Thank you very much for your business, we genuinely appreciate it!

,"Damage to chair sounds reasonable for an older frame model. A newer frame is a $250 upgrade, and it really only buys you a slightly better condition chair- functionality should be the same.

Regarding shipping- it can always be done better, but saving $1-$2 on material, slightly more expensive shipping, and a bit more in employee time has to be passed onto the customer. I imagine many are happy not to have that extra expense passed onto them, even if it means there is a risk of slight scuffs to the chair base. 

Amazon is great, but if anyone is thinking of buying a Crandall chair, going through Crandall is probably better. Full customization, and they are very responsive to questions."
,">I'm abit surprised at how this is packaged, honestly, it's very basic stuff. I work for USPS and see poor packing jobs like this often. It should've been a slightly bigger box, insulated with some foam,

You're not getting any foam even if you order from Steelcase themselves"
,"If you want to add a mesh Lorell headrest to it, guy on eBay sells a spacer that moves it back 1.5"" or so. Seems to be worth it."
,Did you upgrade to their new thicker foam pads for seat & back?  I weigh about 195lbs and bottom out hard in the seat.  It's enough to make me not want to use the chair.
BTOD vs Crandall Advice,"I'm trying to buy a refurbished Herman Miller Aeron Class, and the three places I've seen that refurbish are these 2 and Madison Seating. I can see that Madison has a bad reputation for long shipping estimates and subpar service and warranty, so I want to buy from the other 2. However, I've seen mixed reviews on both of these refurbishers, and quite frankly, I don't know what to choose. If anyone can help me with that, it would be much appreciated. Both seem to have good customer service, and Crandall seems to have longer warranty (12 years) than BTOD (5 years). At this point, I'm stumped."
,"I‚Äôd say it more or less depends on the chairs age then the actual refurbisher. Paying 750-800 for a ancient dot com era Aeron is horrible deal. 

Better yet I‚Äôd reach out to your local HM commerical dealer and see what there offering for price. Buying new through a commerical dealer you can save 30-40% off the retail list price."

A bit of an inside scoop on how they refurbish. Both are great companies, honestly I think you'll be happy with either. I do however, hope that you have tried the Aeron and know you like it as it is a polarizing chair that many people love, but many people also hate it. Best of luck!"
HAG Futu vs Steelcase Gesture,Can someone give me their impression on how these two compare? I could get the HAG Futu for about the same price as a  exhibition model gesture.
"Hi everyone, I need help. please","Let me start with some background information. I have autism and I game on average 6-8 hours a day on the weekends. I needed a good chair for this purpose and thus started digging around on youtube, reddit. and all sorts of information. It is also worth noting that I am from the Netherlands so I am not a native English speaker and my grammar ain't the best, So bare with me haha.

My budget is around 200 Euro's

I quickly found out that racing chairs are pretty bad and cosmetic and for looks only. Then I found 

[This chair:](https://www.amazon.com/Hbada-Ergonomic-Office-Chair-Adjustable/dp/B07P7MQ9D5?th=1) I've done some more digging and quickly found out that chair wasn't the best quality and started to quite literly fall apart and make weird noises after a few months.

Then I've found [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atzf7iHTTCU&t=211s) video on youtube about the [Hyken Tactical mesh](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L26Z2QX/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=techlens0e-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07L26Z2QX&linkId=670d4f5464e5919c36693ab8013e2c2c) and It looked pretty good, only to find out the price has spiked enormously and its basicly impossible to order said chair when not living in the USA, so like me from the Netherlands wont have any luck.

Now I've run out of idea's I feel pretty overwhelmed by this whole picking the right chair experience. A lot of people advice to go for refurbished chairs, but where would I find such a store? Besides that most people say its a personal preferance thing and I might not like what you guys like.

It would be really nice if you guys could eigther 

1. list some chairs below I might like within my budget that are good quality

or

2. Help me with finding a place I can order the Hyken Tactical mesh. 

Maybe you guys know some good brands/places to check out where I can test some chairs.

&#x200B;

Tldr: I feel pretty lost and overwhelmed with finding a good chair around my 200 euro budget. Please help and list some good chairs below. If you feel like this isn't the right subreddit for me, please point me in the right direction.

Thank you all in advance!"
"My experience with Aeron, Leap and Embody","Just thought I'd give a recap of the past couple of weeks as I went about replacing my Knoll Life chair. I bought that chair used, out of the back of a moving van (not joking) in Atlanta. It's held up for about 10 years after: riveting part of the frame together, screwing the armrests in place because the mechanism broke, replacing the padding on the armrests, and the final straw was the side of the frame cracking.

I had always wanted an Aeron chair. Not for any particular comfort reason, but just because it's an icon of a chair. I think I was able to use one for 6 during a contract job, but I honestly don't remember.

I'm a user experience designer, working from home, usually 8+ hours a day. I am able to get away from the desk quite a bit throughout the day, and I have an electric sit-stand desk. Because I have so many things attached to my computer, I rarely use the sit-stand function, maybe 2 or 3 times a month.  I would say on average I'm at my computer for 3'ish hours at a time.  

6'0"", 220lbs

Background out of the way. I started researching the Aeron online. BTOD had, by far, the most material on office chairs, but others came up here and there. Ahnestly on Youtube, this sub, etc.. I quickly went down the remanufactured route, to save costs initially. In looking at the Aeron, the Leap came up in comparisons quite a bit. I went to a local office furniture company and was actually able to test out each chair I was looking at, even different sizes in the Aeron.  Unable to decide between the Leap and the Aeron, I ended up ordering a Leap from Crandall and an Aeron from the local company.  


I really liked the mesh seat and back of the Aeron. The arms were also so cushy. However I didn't like the hard shell of the seatpan. I don't have perfect posture, and like to move around quite a bit, so those hard bits got in the way.

The Leap was always initially comfy, and I really liked that the arms moved separately from the recline. The angle of the armrests got to me though, my elbows would slip outwards. They are also much stiffer. After an hour or so I would start to be uncomfortable in the seat as well.

So I dug around more. If a new Aeron was on the table, I expanded out in that price range. That led me to the Embody (and Gesture). Again, I went down to the local store and tried out both. It was a really tough choice between the two, but aesthetically I liked the Embody. I also read a few more cases of Gestures being more comfortable new then tapering off after a few months. So I went with the Embody. 

Gotta say, I'm really liking the Embody. I like the large seat pan, I don't feel any pressure or discomfort anywhere on my legs. The arms are natural (the feature I was most worried about). They don't have the cush of the Aeron's pads, but they're still nice. I think this is the one. I'm looking forward to the Atlas headrest sometime in the future. My only real concern with it right now is the longevity. There's a lot of, what seems like, delicate parts. Hopefully that's put to ease with the Herman Miller warranty. 

Putting these thoughts out there in case it helps anyone else.

&#x200B;

tldr; Tried the Leap, Aeron and Embody. Liked the Embody the most."
,"Ive had the good fortune of working in large office environments almost exclusively with Herman Miller and Steelcase chairs. Ive tried the Aeron twice and both times basically hated it. The plastic around the seat pan always dug into my legs eventually and it just want very comfortable. Tried a couple leaps and they were ok but eventually my favorite was the Amia. 

It was the only chair I could legitimately sit of for hours and not feel like I needed to get out of it from time time to time. 

I was going to get one for the home office since my current chair broke while I was waiting for the great post pandemic office liquidation that was supposed to flood the market with tons of used cheap office equipment that never happened but I found a great local deal on a Haworth Zody so Im going to see how that is for a bit."
,"I liked the leap a lot better, cheaper too"
,"Thanks for sharing your experience - I know a lot of people here are directly comparing the 4 of these chairs, and will likely find this very helpful! I personally sit in a Gesture and absolutely love it, but sounds like the Embody is the right fit for you - congrats on your new chair!! :)
